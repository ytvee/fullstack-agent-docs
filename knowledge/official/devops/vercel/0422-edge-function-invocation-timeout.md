# EDGE_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT

The `EDGE_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` error occurs when an Edge Function takes longer than the allowed execution time to complete or doesn't send a response chunk for a certain amount of time. This can be caused by long-running processes within the function or external dependencies that fail to respond in a timely manner.

If your backend API takes time to respond, we recommend [streaming the response](/docs/functions/streaming-functions) to avoid the idle timeout. For longer-running workloads, consider migrating to [Fluid compute](/docs/fluid-compute) which provides significantly longer durations and optimized performance.

**Error Code:** `504`

**Name:** Gateway Timeout

## Troubleshoot

To troubleshoot this error, follow these steps:

1. **Check application logs**: Review the application logs to identify any specific errors related to the Edge Function being invoked. They can be found at the host URL under [the `/_logs` path](/docs/deployments/build-features#logs-view)
2. **Review function code:** Inspect the Edge Function code for any long-running operations or infinite loops that could cause a timeout
3. **Verify return value:** Ensure the function returns a response within the specified time limit of [25 seconds](/docs/functions/limitations#max-duration)
4. **Optimize external calls:** If the function makes calls to external services or APIs, ensure they are optimized and responding quickly
5. **Consider streaming data**: If the function is processing large amounts of data, consider using a [streaming approach](/docs/functions/streaming-functions) to avoid timeouts
6. **Implement error handling:** Add error handling in the function to manage timeouts and other exceptions effectively

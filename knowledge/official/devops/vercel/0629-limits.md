# Limits

## General limits

To prevent abuse of our platform, we apply the following limits to all accounts.

|                                                                                           | Hobby                                                                              | Pro                                                             | Enterprise                                                      |

For Teams on the Pro plan, you can pay for [usage](/docs/limits#additional-resources) on-demand.

## On-demand resources for Pro

For members of our Pro plan, we offer an included credit that can be used across all resources and a pay-as-you-go model for additional consumption, giving you greater flexibility and control over your usage. The typical monthly usage guidelines above are still applicable, while extra usage will be automatically charged at the following rates:

## Pro trial limits

See the [Pro trial limitations](/docs/plans/pro-plan/trials#trial-limitations) section for information on the limits that apply to Pro trials.

## Routes created per deployment

The limit of "Routes created per Deployment" encapsulates several options that can be configured on Vercel:

- If you are using a `vercel.json` configuration file, each [rewrite](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites), [redirect](/docs/project-configuration#redirects), or [header](/docs/project-configuration#headers) is counted as a Route
- If you are using the [Build Output API](/docs/build-output-api/v3), you might configure [routes](/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#routes) for your deployments

Note that most frameworks will create Routes automatically for you. For example, Next.js will create a set of Routes corresponding to your use of [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), [redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting), [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) and [custom headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/headers).

## Build time per deployment

The maximum duration of the [Build Step](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) is 45 minutes.
When the limit is reached, the Build Step will be interrupted and the Deployment will fail.

### Build container resources

Every build container has a fixed amount of resources available to it. You can find the resources available for each build machine type [here](/docs/builds/managing-builds#larger-build-machines).

For more information on troubleshooting these, see [Build container resources](/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#build-container-resources).

## Static file uploads

When using the CLI to deploy, the maximum size of the source files that can be uploaded is limited to 100 MB for Hobby and 1 GB for Pro. If the size of the source files exceeds this limit, the deployment will fail.

### Build cache maximum size

The maximum size of the Build's cache is 1 GB. It is retained for one month and it applies at the level of each [Build cache key](/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#caching-process).

## Monitoring

Check out [the limits and pricing section](/docs/observability/monitoring/limits-and-pricing) for more details about the limits of the [Monitoring](/docs/observability/monitoring) feature on Vercel.

## Logs

There are two types of logs: **build logs** and **runtime logs**. Both have different behaviors when storing logs.

[Build logs](/docs/deployments/logs) are stored indefinitely for each deployment.

[Runtime logs](/docs/runtime-logs) are stored for **1 hour** on Hobby, **1 day** on Pro, and for **3 days** on Enterprise accounts. To learn more about these log limits, [read here](/docs/runtime-logs#limits).

## Environment variables

The maximum number of [Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables) per environment per [Project](/docs/projects/overview)
is `1000`. For example, you cannot have more than `1000` Production Environment Variables.

The total size of your Environment Variables, names and values, is limited to **64KB** for projects using Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, and .NET runtimes. This limit is the total allowed for each deployment, and is also the maximum size of any single Environment Variable. For more information, see the [Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables#environment-variable-size) documentation.

If you are using [System Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables/system-environment-variables), the framework-specific ones (i.e. those prefixed by the framework name) are exposed only during the Build Step, but not at runtime. However, the non-framework-specific ones are exposed at runtime. Only the Environment Variables that are exposed at runtime are counted towards the size limit.

## Domains

|                     | Hobby | Pro         | Enterprise  |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Domains per Project | 50    | Unlimited\* | Unlimited\* |

- To prevent abuse, Vercel implements soft limits of 100,000 domains per project for the Pro plan and 1,000,000 domains for the Enterprise plan. These limits are flexible and can be increased upon request. If you need more domains, please [contact our support team](/help) for assistance.

## Files

The maximum number of files that can be uploaded when creating a CLI [Deployment](/docs/deployments) is `15,000` for source files. Deployments that contain more files than the limit will fail at the [build step](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build).

Although there is no upper limit for output files created during a build, you can expect longer build times as a result of having many thousands of output files (100,000 or more, for example). If the build time exceeds 45 minutes then the build will fail.

We recommend using [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) (ISR) to help reduce build time. Using ISR will allow you pre-render a subset of the total number of pages at build time, giving you faster builds and the ability to generate pages on-demand.

## Proxied request timeout

The amount of time (in seconds) that a proxied request (`rewrites` or `routes` with an external destination) is allowed to process an HTTP request. The maximum timeout is **120 seconds** (2 minutes).
If the external server does not reply until the maximum timeout is reached, an error with the message `ROUTER_EXTERNAL_TARGET_ERROR` will be returned.

## WebSockets

[Vercel Functions](/docs/functions) do not support acting as a WebSocket server.

We recommend third-party [solutions](/kb/guide/publish-and-subscribe-to-realtime-data-on-vercel) to enable realtime communication for [Deployments](/docs/deployments).

## Web Analytics

Check out the [Limits and Pricing section](/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing) for more details about the limits of Vercel Web Analytics.

## Speed Insights

Check out the [Limits and Pricing](/docs/speed-insights/limits-and-pricing) doc for more details about the limits of the Speed Insights feature on Vercel.

## Cron Jobs

Check out the Cron Jobs [limits](/docs/cron-jobs/usage-and-pricing) section for more information about the limits of Cron Jobs on Vercel.

## Vercel Functions

The limits of Vercel functions are based on the [runtime](/docs/functions/runtimes) that you use.

For example, different runtimes allow for different [bundle sizes](/docs/functions/runtimes#bundle-size-limits), [maximum duration](/docs/functions/runtimes/edge#maximum-execution-duration), and [memory](/docs/functions/runtimes#memory-size-limits).

If you have an existing project, deployed to Vercel before April 23rd 2025 and **not using Fluid compute**, Vercel Functions have the following defaults and maximum limits for the duration of a function:

|            | Default | Maximum           |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Hobby      | 10s     | 60s (1 minute)    |
| Pro        | 15s     | 300s (5 minutes)  |
| Enterprise | 15s     | 900s (15 minutes) |

## Connecting a project to a Git repository

​Vercel does not support connecting a project on your Hobby team to Git repositories owned by Git organizations. You can either switch to an existing Team or create a new one.

The same limitation applies in the Project creation flow when importing an existing Git repository or when cloning a Vercel template to a new Git repository as part of your Git organization.

## Reserved variables

See the [Reserved Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables/reserved-environment-variables) docs for more information.

## Rate limits

**Rate limits** are hard limits that apply to the platform when performing actions that require a response from our [API](/docs/rest-api#api-basics).

The **rate limits** table consists of the following four columns:

- **Description** - A brief summary of the limit which, where relevant, will advise what type of plan it applies to.
- **Limit** - The amount of actions permitted within the amount of time (**Duration**) specified.
- **Duration** - The amount of time (seconds) in which you can perform the specified amount of actions. Once a rate limit is hit, it will be reset after the **Duration** has expired.
- **Scope** - How the rate limit is applied:
  - `owner` - Rate limit applies to the team or to an individual user, depending on the resource.
  - `user` - Rate limit applies to an individual user.
  - `team` - Rate limit applies to the team.

### Rate limit examples

Below are five examples that provide further information on how rate limits work.

#### Domain deletion

You are able to delete up to `60` domains every `60` seconds (1 minute). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another minute before you can delete another domain.

#### Team deletion

You are able to delete up to `20` teams every `3600` seconds (1 hour). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another hour before you can delete another team.

#### Username change

You are able to change your username up to `6` times every `604800` seconds (1 week). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another week before you can change your username again.

#### Builds per hour (Hobby)

You are able to build `32` [Deployments](/docs/deployments) every `3600` seconds (1 hour). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another hour before you can build a deployment again.

> **💡 Note:** Using Next.js or any similar framework to build your deployment is classed as
> a build. Each Vercel Function is also classed as a build. Hosting static files
> such as an index.html file is not classed as a build.

#### Deployments per day (Hobby)

You are able to deploy `100` times every `86400` seconds (1 day). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another day before you can deploy again.

The following table lists all API rate limits that apply when using the [Vercel REST API](/docs/rest-api#api-basics). These limits apply to actions such as deployments, domain management, team operations, and more.

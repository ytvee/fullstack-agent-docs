# Adding a Provider

When you Open **AI** in the sidebar, you'll see a list of installed AI integrations. If you don't have installed integrations, you can browse and connect to the AI models and services that best fit your project's needs.

## Adding a native integration provider

1. Select the **Install AI Provider** button on the top right of the **AI** dashboard page.
2. From the list of Marketplace AI Providers, select the provider that you would like to install and click **Continue**.
3. Select a plan from the list of available plans that can include both prepaid and post-paid plans.
   - For prepaid plans, once you select your plan and click Continue:
     - You are taken to a **Manage Funds** screen where you can set up an initial balance for the prepayment.
     - You can also enable auto recharge with a maximum monthly spend. Auto recharge can also be configured at a later stage.
4. Click **Continue**, provide a name for your installation and click **Install**.
5. Once the installation is complete, you are taken to the installation's detail page where you can:
   - Link a project by clicking **Connect Project**
   - Follow a quickstart in different languages to test your installation
   - View the list of all connected projects
   - View the usage of the service

For more information on managing native integration providers, review [Manage native integrations](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration#manage-native-integrations).

## Adding a connectable account provider

If no integrations are installed, browse the list of available providers and click on the provider you would like to add.

1. Select the **Add** button next to the provider you want to integrate
2. Review the provider card which displays the models available, along with a description of the provider and links to their website, pricing, and documentation
3. Select the **Add Provider** button
4. You can now select which projects the provider will have access to. You can choose from **All Projects** or **Specific Projects**
   - If you select **Specific Projects**, you'll be prompted to select the projects you want to connect to the provider. The list will display projects associated with your scoped team
   - Multiple projects can be selected during this step
5. Select the **Connect to Project** button
6. You'll be redirected to the provider's website to complete the connection process
7. Once the connection is complete, you'll be redirected back to the Vercel dashboard, and the provider integration dashboard page. From here you can manage your provider settings, view usage, and more

Once you add a provider, the **AI** section in the sidebar will display a list of the providers you have installed or connected to. To add more providers:

1. Select the **Install AI Provider** button on the top right of the page.
2. Browse down to the list of connectable accounts.
3. Select the provider that you would like to connect to and click **Continue** and follow the instructions from step 4 above.

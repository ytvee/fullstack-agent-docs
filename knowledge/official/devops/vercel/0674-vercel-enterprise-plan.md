# Vercel Enterprise Plan

Vercel offers an Enterprise plan for organizations and enterprises that need high [performance](#performance-and-reliability), advanced [security](#security-and-compliance), and dedicated [support](#administration-and-support).

## Performance and reliability

The Enterprise plan uses isolated build infrastructure on high-grade hardware with no queues to ensure exceptional performance and a seamless experience.

- Greater function limits for [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions/runtimes) including bundle size, duration, memory, and concurrency
- Automatic failover regions for [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#automatic-failover)
- Greater multi-region limits for [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#project-configuration)
- Vercel functions memory [configurable](/docs/functions/runtimes#size-limits) to 3009 MB
- Configurable [Vercel Function](/docs/functions) up to a [maximum duration](/docs/functions/runtimes#max-duration) of 900-seconds
- Unlimited [domains](/docs/domains) per project
- [Custom SSL Certificates](/docs/domains/custom-SSL-certificate)
- Automatic concurrency scaling up to 100,000 for [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions/concurrency-scaling#automatic-concurrency-scaling)
- [Isolated
  build infrastructure](/docs/security#do-enterprise-accounts-run-on-a-different-infrastructure),
  with the ability to have [larger memory and storage](/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#build-container-resources)
- [Trusted Proxy](/docs/headers/request-headers#x-forwarded-for)

## Security and compliance

Data and infrastructure security is paramount in the Enterprise plan with advanced features including:

- [SSO/SAML Login](/docs/saml)

  [Private Production Deployments](/docs/security/deployment-protection#configuring-deployment-protection),
  and [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips)

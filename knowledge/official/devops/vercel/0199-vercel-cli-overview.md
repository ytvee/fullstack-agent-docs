# Vercel CLI Overview

Vercel gives you multiple ways to interact with and configure your Vercel Projects. With the command-line interface (CLI) you can interact with the Vercel platform using a terminal, or through an automated system, enabling you to [retrieve logs](/docs/cli/logs), manage [certificates](/docs/cli/certs), replicate your deployment environment [locally](/docs/cli/dev), manage Domain Name System (DNS) [records](/docs/cli/dns), and more.

If you'd like to interface with the platform programmatically, check out the [REST API documentation](/docs/rest-api).

## Installing Vercel CLI

To download and install Vercel CLI, run the following command:

<CodeBlock>
  <Code tab="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
  <Code tab="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
  <Code tab="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
  <Code tab="bun">
    ```bash
    bun i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
</CodeBlock>

## Updating Vercel CLI

When there is a new release of Vercel CLI, running any command will show you a message letting you know that an update is available.

If you have installed our command-line interface through [npm](http://npmjs.org/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), the easiest way to update it is by running the installation command yet again.

<CodeBlock>
  <Code tab="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
  <Code tab="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
  <Code tab="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
  <Code tab="bun">
    ```bash
    bun i vercel
    ```
  </Code>
</CodeBlock>

If you see permission errors, please read npm's [official guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally). Yarn depends on the same configuration as npm.

## Checking the version

The `--version` option can be used to verify the version of Vercel CLI currently being used.

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel --version
```

*Using the \`vercel\` command with the \`--version\` option.*

## Using in a CI/CD environment

Vercel CLI requires you to log in and authenticate before accessing resources or performing administrative tasks. In a terminal environment, you can use [`vercel login`](/docs/cli/login), which requires manual input. In a CI/CD environment where manual input is not possible, you can create a token on your [tokens page](/account/tokens) and then use the [`--token` option](/docs/cli/global-options#token) to authenticate.

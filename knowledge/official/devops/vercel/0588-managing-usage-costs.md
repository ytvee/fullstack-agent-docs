# Managing Usage & Costs

## Measuring usage

> **💡 Note:** This document describes usage for the default pricing option.

> until the contract expires.

Your Image Optimization usage over time is displayed under the **Image Optimization** section of the [Usage](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F~%2Fusage%23image-optimization-image-transformations\&title=Go%20to%20Usage) section in the sidebar on your dashboard.

You can also view detailed information in the **Image Optimization** section of the [Observability](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F~%2Fobservability%2Fimage-optimization\&title=Go%20to%20Observability) section in the sidebar on your dashboard.

## Reducing usage

To help you minimize Image Optimization usage costs, consider implementing the following suggestions:

- **Cache Max Age**: If your images do not change in less than a month, set `max-age=2678400` (31 days) in the `Cache-Control` header or set [`images.minimumCacheTTL`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#minimumcachettl) to `minimumCacheTTL:2678400` to reduce the number of transformations and cache writes. Using static imports can also help as they set the `Cache-Control` header to 1 year.

- **Formats**: Check if your Next.js configuration is using [`images.formats`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#formats) with multiple values and consider removing one. For example, change `['image/avif', 'image/web']` to `['image/webp']` to reduce the number of transformations.

- **Remote and local patterns**: Configure [`images.remotePatterns`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns) and [`images.localPatterns`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#localpatterns) allowlist which images should be optimized so that you can limit unnecessary transformations and cache writes.

- **Qualities**: Configure the [`images.qualities`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#qualities) allowlist to reduce possible transformations. Lowering the quality will make the transformed image smaller resulting in fewer cache reads, cache writes, and fast data transfer.

- **Image sizes**: Configure the [`images.imageSizes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#imagesizes) and [`images.deviceSizes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#devicesizes) allowlists to match your audience and reduce the number of transformations and cache writes.

- **Unoptimized**: For source images that do not benefit from optimization such as small images (under 10 KB), vector images (SVG) and animated images (GIF), use the [`unoptimized` property](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized) on the Image component to avoid transformations, cache reads, and cache writes. Use sparingly since `unoptimized` on every image could increase fast data transfer cost.

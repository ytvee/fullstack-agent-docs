# vercel dev

The `vercel dev` command is used to replicate the Vercel deployment environment locally, allowing you to test your [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions) and [Middleware](/docs/routing-middleware) without requiring you to deploy each time a change is made.

If the [Development Command](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#development-command) is configured in your Project Settings, it will affect the behavior of `vercel dev` for everyone on that team.

> **💡 Note:** Before running `vercel dev`, make sure to install your
> dependencies by running `npm install`.

## When to Use This Command

If you're using a framework and your framework's [Development Command](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#development-command) already provides all the features you need, we do not recommend using `vercel dev`.

For example, [Next.js](/docs/frameworks/nextjs)'s Development Command (`next dev`) provides native support for Functions, [redirects](/docs/redirects#configuration-redirects), rewrites, headers and more.

## Usage

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel dev
```

*Using the \`vercel dev\` command from the root of a
Vercel Project directory.*

## Unique Options

These are options that only apply to the `vercel dev` command.

### Listen

The `--listen` option, shorthand `-l`, can be used to specify which port `vercel dev` runs on.

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel dev --listen 5005
```

*Using the \`vercel dev\` command with the
\`--listen\` option.*

### Yes

The `--yes` option can be used to skip questions you are asked when setting up a new Vercel Project.
The questions will be answered with the default scope and current directory for the Vercel Project name and location.

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel dev --yes
```

*Using the \`vercel dev\` command with the
\`--yes\` option.*

## Global Options

The following [global options](/docs/cli/global-options) can be passed when using the  command:

- [`--cwd`](/docs/cli/global-options#current-working-directory)
- [`--debug`](/docs/cli/global-options#debug)
- [`--global-config`](/docs/cli/global-options#global-config)
- [`--help`](/docs/cli/global-options#help)
- [`--local-config`](/docs/cli/global-options#local-config)
- [`--no-color`](/docs/cli/global-options#no-color)
- [`--scope`](/docs/cli/global-options#scope)
- [`--token`](/docs/cli/global-options#token)

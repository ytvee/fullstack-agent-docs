# Deployment Protection on Vercel

Deployment Protection lets you control who can access your preview and production URLs. You configure it at the project level, choosing both a **protection method** (how you protect) and a **protection scope** (what you protect).

> **⚠️ Warning:** On the Hobby plan, Vercel Authentication with Standard Protection is
> available. This protects your preview deployments and deployment URLs, but your
> production domain remains publicly accessible. To protect production domains,
> you need a Pro or Enterprise plan.

Deployment Protection requires authentication for all requests, including those to Routing Middleware.

## What protection methods are available

You can choose from three methods to protect your deployments:

- [**Vercel Authentication**](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication): Restricts access to only Vercel users with suitable access rights. **Available on all plans**
- [**Password Protection**](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection): Restricts access to users with the correct password. **Available on the Enterprise plan, or as a paid add-on for Pro plans**
- [**Trusted IPs**](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips): Restricts access to users with the correct IP address. **Available on the Enterprise plan**

## Choose which URLs to protect

The protection scope determines which URLs you protect:

- [**Standard Protection**](#standard-protection): Protects all deployments **except** production domains. **Available on all plans**
- [**All Deployments**](#all-deployments): Protects **all** URLs, including production domains. **Available on Pro and Enterprise plans**
- [**(Legacy) Standard Protection**](#legacy-standard-protection): Protects all preview URLs and deployment URLs. All up-to-date production URLs remain unprotected.
- [**(Legacy) Only Preview Deployments**](#legacy-only-preview-deployments): Protects only preview URLs. Does not protect past production deployments.

To protect [**only production URLs**](#only-production-deployments), use [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips). This option is **only available on the Enterprise plan**.

## Where to find Deployment Protection settings

You manage Deployment Protection through your project settings:

1. From the [dashboard](/dashboard), select the project you want to configure
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar and select [**Deployment Protection**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdeployment-protection\&title=Go+to+Deployment+Protection+settings)

### How team default settings apply to new projects

You can set a default Deployment Protection configuration for new projects in your team settings. You can override this default on individual projects as needed.

When setting a team default, choose the protection level (All Deployments, Standard Protection, or None) and one of the available protection methods, including Vercel Authentication or Password Protection.

## Standard Protection

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Standard Protection

**Standard Protection** is the recommended option for most projects. It protects all domains except [production domains](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain "Production Domains").

![Image](`/contentful/image/e5382hct74si/7LHNvuRkcDlKMWswY7c8xd/858a8627a82bcec2c456bcd42618b3f5/Screenshot_2025-07-09_at_5.05.58%C3%A2__pm.png`)

You can combine Standard Protection with any of the following methods:

- [Vercel Authentication](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication)
- [Password Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection)
- [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips)

### How to migrate to Standard Protection

When you enable Standard Protection, the production [generated deployment URL](/docs/deployments/generated-urls) becomes restricted. Update any fetch requests that use `VERCEL_URL` or `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` from [System Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#system-environment-variables) to target the same domain the user requested, since those variables will no longer be publicly accessible.

> **💡 Note:** The Framework Environment Variable `VERCEL_URL` is prefixed with the name of
> the framework. For example, `VERCEL_URL` for Next.js is
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL`, and `VERCEL_URL` for Nuxt is `NUXT_ENV_VERCEL_URL`.
> See the [Framework Environment
> Variables](/docs/environment-variables/framework-environment-variables)
> documentation for more information.

For client-side requests, use relative paths in the fetch call to target the current domain. This automatically includes the user's authentication cookie for protected URLs:

```ts
// Before
fetch(`${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/some/path`);

// After
fetch('/some/path');
// Note: For operations requiring fully qualified URLs, such as generating OG images,
// replace '/some/path' with the actual domain (e.g. 'https://yourdomain.com/some/path').
```

For server-side requests, use the origin from the incoming request and manually add request cookies to pass the user's authentication cookie:

```ts
const headers = { cookie: <incoming request header cookies> };
fetch('<incoming request origin>/some/path', { headers });
```

Bypassing protection using [Protection Bypass for Automation](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation) is an option but not required for requests targeting the same domain.

## All Deployments

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Protecting all deployments

Select **All Deployments** to secure all deployments (both preview and production), restricting public access entirely.

With this configuration, all URLs are protected, including your production domain `example.com` and [generated URLs](/docs/deployments/generated-urls) like `my-project-1234.vercel.app`.

![Image](`/front/docs/security/all-deployments-light.png`)

You can combine All Deployments protection with any of the following methods:

- [Vercel Authentication](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication)
- [Password Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection)
- [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips)

## Only Production Deployments

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Protecting production deployments

Use [Trusted IPs](/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips) to restrict access to production deployments to a specific list of IPv4 addresses.

Preview deployment URLs remain publicly accessible. This feature is **only available on the Enterprise plan**.

![Image](`/front/docs/security/prod-deployments-light.png`)

## (Legacy) Standard Protection

**(Legacy) Standard Protection** protects all preview URLs and [deployment URLs](/docs/deployments/generated-urls "Deployment URLs"). All [up to date production URLs](/docs/deployments/generated-urls "Up to date Production URLs") remain unprotected.

## (Legacy) Only Preview Deployments

Select **(Legacy) Only Preview Deployments** to protect preview URLs while the production environment remains publicly accessible.

For example, Vercel generates a preview URL such as `my-preview-5678.vercel.app`, which will be protected. In contrast, all production URLs, including any past or current generated production branch URLs like `*-main.vercel.app`, remain accessible.

## Advanced Deployment Protection

Advanced Deployment Protection features are available to Enterprise customers by default. Pro plan customers can access these features for an additional $150 per month:

- [Password Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection)
- [Private Production Deployments](/docs/security/deployment-protection#all-deployments)
- [Deployment Protection Exceptions](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/deployment-protection-exceptions)

### Enabling Advanced Deployment Protection

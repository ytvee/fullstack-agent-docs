# FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE

The `FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` error occurs when the payload sent to a function exceeds the maximum allowed size. This typically happens when the data sent in the request body to a serverless function is larger than the server can process.

**Error Code:** `413`

**Name:** Payload Too Large

## Troubleshoot

To troubleshoot this error, follow these steps:

1. **Review payload size:** Check the size of the payload being sent to the function to ensure it's within the allowed limits, and does not exceed the [limit of 4.5MB](/docs/functions/runtimes#size-limits)
2. **Reduce payload size:** If possible, reduce the size of the payload being sent to the function. This might include sending less data or compressing the data before sending it
3. **Client-side uploads**: For large file uploads, consider using client-side uploads directly to [Vercel Blob](/docs/storage/vercel-blob#server-and-client-uploads), where the file is sent securely from the client to Vercel Blob without going through the server
4. **Split into multiple requests:** If the payload data is too large to be sent in a single request, consider splitting the data into smaller chunks and sending multiple requests
5. **Use external storage:** If the data is very large, consider using external storage solutions to handle the data instead of sending it directly in the request

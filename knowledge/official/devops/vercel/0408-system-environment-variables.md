# System environment variables

Vercel provides a set of environment variables that are automatically populated by the system, such as the URL of the deployment or the name of the Git branch deployed.

## Automatically expose system environment variables

To expose these environment variables to your deployments:

1. Navigate to your project on your [dashboard](/dashboard).
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar and click on [**Environment Variables**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fenvironment-variables\&title=Go+to+Environment+Variables).
3. Select the **Automatically expose System Environment Variables** checkbox.

> **⚠️ Warning:** If you disable this setting, no deployment ID will be made available for supported frameworks (like Next.js) to use, which means [Skew Protection](/docs/skew-protection) will also be disabled.

## System environment variables

If you are using a framework for your project, Vercel provides the following prefixed environment variables:

> **💡 Note:** When you choose to automatically expose system environment variables, some
> React warnings, such as those in a `create-react-app` will display as build

> error?](/kb/guide/how-do-i-resolve-a-process-env-ci-true-error)

# Notebooks

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Notebooks

**Notebooks** allow you to collect and manage multiple queries related to your application's metrics and performance data.

Within a single notebook, you can store multiple queries that examine different aspects of your system - each with its own specific filters, time ranges, and data aggregations.
You can build comprehensive dashboards or analysis workflows by grouping related queries together.

> **💡 Note:** You need to enable [Observability
> Plus](/docs/observability/observability-plus) to use Notebooks since you need
> run queries.

## Using and managing notebooks

You can use notebooks to organize and save your queries. Each notebook is a collection of queries that you can keep personal or share with your team.

### Create a notebook

1. From [**Observability**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fobservability\&title=Go+to+Observability) in your dashboard sidebar, click **Notebooks** from the left navigation of the Observability Overview page
2. Edit the notebook name by clicking the pencil icon on the top left of the default title which uses your username and created date and time.

### Add a query to a notebook

1. From the **Notebooks** page, click the **Create Notebook** button or select an existing **Notebook**
2. Click the + icon to open the query builder and build your query
3. Edit the query name by clicking the pencil icon on the top left of the default query title
4. Select the most appropriate view for your query: line chart, volume chart, table or big number
5. Once you're happy with your query results, save it by clicking **Save Query**
6. Your query is now available in your notebook

### Delete a query

1. From the **Notebooks** page, select an existing **Notebook**
2. Click the three-dot menu on the top-right corner of a query, and select **Delete**. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Delete a notebook

1. From the **Notebooks** page, select the **Notebook** you'd like to delete from the list
2. Click the three-dot menu on the top-right corner of the notebook, and select **Delete notebook**. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Notebook types and access

You can create 2 types of notebooks.

- Personal Notebooks: Only the creator and owner can view them.
- Team Notebooks: All team members can view them and they share ownership.

When created, notebooks are personal by default. You can use the **Share** button to turn them to Team Notebooks for collaboration. When shared, all team members have full access to modify, add, or remove content within the notebook.

As a Notebook owner, you have complete control over your notebook. You can add new queries, edit existing ones, remove individual queries, or delete the entire notebook if it's no longer needed.

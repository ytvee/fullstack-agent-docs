# Vercel CMS Integrations

These integrations provide a direct path to incorporating CMS into your applications, enabling you to build, deploy, and leverage CMS-powered features with minimal hassle.

You can use the following methods to integrate your CMS with Vercel:

- [**Environment variable import**](#environment-variable-import): Quickly setup your Vercel project with environment variables from your CMS
- [**Edit Mode through the Vercel Toolbar**](#edit-mode-with-the-vercel-toolbar): Visualize content from your CMS within a Vercel deployments and edit directly in your CMS
  - [**Content Link**](/docs/edit-mode#content-link): Lets you visualize content models from your CMS within a Vercel deployments and edit directly in your CMS
- [**Deploy changes from CMS**](#deploy-changes-from-cms): Connect and deploy content from your CMS to your Vercel site

## Environment variable import

The most common way to setup a CMS with Vercel is by installing an integration through the [Integrations Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations#cms). This method allows you to quickly setup your Vercel project with environment variables from your CMS.

Once a CMS has been installed, and a project linked you can pull in environment variables from the CMS to your Vercel project using the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli/env).

- ### Install the Vercel CLI
  To pull in environment variables from  to your Vercel project, you need to install the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli). Run the following command in your terminal:
  <CodeBlock>
    <Code tab="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm i vercel
      ```
    </Code>
    <Code tab="yarn">
      ```bash
      yarn i vercel
      ```
    </Code>
    <Code tab="npm">
      ```bash
      npm i vercel
      ```
    </Code>
    <Code tab="bun">
      ```bash
      bun i vercel
      ```
    </Code>
  </CodeBlock>

- ### Install your CMS integration
  Navigate to the  and follow the steps to install the integration.

- ### Pull in environment variables
  Once you've installed the  integration, you can pull in environment variables from  to your Vercel project. In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  vercel env pull
  ```

See your installed CMSs documentation for next steps on how to use the integration.

## Edit mode with the Vercel Toolbar

To access Edit Mode:

1. Ensure you're logged into the [Vercel Toolbar](/docs/vercel-toolbar) with your Vercel account.
2. Navigate to a page with editable content. The  **Edit Mode** option will only appear in the [Vercel Toolbar](/docs/vercel-toolbar) menu when there are elements on the page matched to fields in the CMS.
3. Select the  **Edit Mode** option in the toolbar menu. This will highlight the editable fields as [Content Links](/docs/edit-mode#content-link), which turn blue as you hover near them.

The following CMS integrations support Content Link:

## Why is telemetry collected?

Vercel CLI Telemetry provides an accurate gauge of Vercel CLI feature usage, pain points, and customization across all users. This data enables tailoring the Vercel CLI to your needs, supports its continued growth and relevance, and optimal developer experience, as well as verifies if improvements are enhancing the baseline performance of all applications.

## What is being collected?

Vercel takes privacy and security seriously. Vercel CLI Telemetry tracks general usage information, such as commands and arguments used. Specifically, the following are tracked:

- Command invoked (`vercel build`, `vercel deploy`, `vercel login`, etc.)
- Version of the Vercel CLI
- General machine information (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux, whether or not the command was run within CI)

**This list is regularly audited to ensure its accuracy.**

You can view exactly what is being collected by setting the following environment variable: `VERCEL_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1`.

When this environment variable is set, data will **not be sent to Vercel**. The data will only be printed out to the [*stderr* stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams), prefixed with `[telemetry]`.

An example telemetry event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "cf9022fd-e4b3-4f67-bda2-f02dba5b2e40",
  "eventTime": 1728421688109,
  "key": "subcommand:ls",
  "value": "ls",
  "teamId": "team_9Cdf9AE0j9ef09FaSdEU0f0s",
  "sessionId": "e29b9b32-3edd-4599-92d2-f6886af005f6"
}
```

## What about sensitive data?

Vercel CLI Telemetry **does not** collect any metrics which may contain sensitive data, including, but not limited to: environment variables, file paths, contents of files, logs, or serialized JavaScript errors.

# Backends on Vercel

Backends deployed to Vercel receive the benefits of Vercel's infrastructure, including:

- [Fluid compute](/docs/fluid-compute): Zero-configuration, optimized concurrency, dynamic scaling, background processing, automatic cold-start prevention, region failover, and more
- [Active CPU pricing](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing): Only pay for the CPU you use, not waiting for I/O (e.g. calling AI models, database queries)
- [Instant Rollback](/docs/instant-rollback): Quickly revert to a previous production deployment
- [Vercel Firewall](/docs/vercel-firewall): A robust, multi-layered security system designed to protect your applications
- [Preview deployments with Deployment Protection](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production): Secure your preview environments and test changes safely before production
- [Rolling releases](/docs/rolling-releases): Gradually roll out backends to detect errors early

## Adapting to Serverless and Fluid compute

If you are transitioning from a fully managed server or containerized environment to Vercel’s serverless architecture, you may need to rethink a few concepts in your application since there is no longer a server always running in the background.

The following are generally applicable to serverless, and therefore Vercel Functions (running with or without Fluid compute).

### Websockets

Serverless functions have maximum execution limits and should respond as quickly as possible. They should not subscribe to data events. Instead, we need a client that subscribes to data events and a serverless functions that publishes new data. Consider using a serverless friendly realtime data provider.

### Database Connections

To manage database connections efficiently, [use the `attachDatabasePool` function from `@vercel/functions`](/docs/functions/functions-api-reference/vercel-functions-package#database-connection-pool-management).

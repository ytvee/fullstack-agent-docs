# Managing Builds

> **💡 Note:** Turbo build machines are now enabled by default for new Pro projects - [Learn
> more](/docs/builds/managing-builds#larger-build-machines)

When you build your application code, Vercel runs compute to install dependencies, run your build script, and sends the build output to our [Compute](/docs/fluid-compute) and [CDN](/docs/cdn).

By default, we enable our fastest build settings for Pro customers' new projects: [Turbo build machines](#larger-build-machines) and [On-Demand Concurrent Builds](#on-demand-concurrent-builds).

- If you're on a Hobby plan and looking for faster builds, we recommend [upgrading to Pro](/docs/plans/pro-plan).
- If you're on an Enterprise plan, build machines are managed as a part of your contract.

[Visit Build Diagnostics in the Observability section in the Vercel dashboard sidebar](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fobservability%2Fbuild-diagnostics\&title=Visit+Build+Diagnostics) to find your build durations. You can also use this table to quickly identify which solution fits your needs:

## Larger build machines

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Elastic, Enhanced, and Turbo build machines

For Pro and Enterprise customers, we offer three higher-tier build machines with more compute resources than Standard. Elastic build machines auto-scale based on your recent build durations. Turbo build machines are enabled by default for new Pro projects.

| Build machine type | Number of vCPUs | Memory (GB) | Disk size (GB) |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Standard           | 4               | 8           | 23             |
| Enhanced           | 8               | 16          | 56             |
| Turbo              | 30              | 60          | 64             |
| Elastic            | 4-30            | 8-60        | Auto-scaled    |

You can set the build machine type in the **Build and Deployment** section of your settings [for your team](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fbuild-and-deployment%23build-machines\&title=Set+team+level+build+machines) or [for individual projects](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fbuild-and-deployment%23build-machine\&title=Configure+your+build+machine).

When your team uses Elastic, Enhanced, or Turbo machines, usage contributes to your build usage charges. Elastic build machines are billed by CPU minute, starting at $0.0035 per CPU minute.

Enterprise customers who have Enhanced build machines enabled via contract will always use them by default. You can view if you have this enabled in [the Build Machines section of the Build and Deployment tab in your Team Settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fbuild-and-deployment%23build-machines\&title=Configure+your+build+machines). To update your build machine preferences, you need to contact your account manager.

## On-demand concurrent builds

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: On-demand concurrent builds

On-demand concurrent builds allow your builds to skip the queue and run immediately. By default, projects have on-demand concurrent builds enabled with full concurrency. Learn more about [concurrency modes](/docs/builds/build-queues#with-on-demand-concurrent-builds).

You are charged for on-demand concurrent builds based on the number of concurrent builds required to allow the builds to proceed as explained in [usage and limits](#usage-and-limits).

### Project-level on-demand concurrent builds

When you enable on-demand build concurrency at the level of a project, any queued builds in that project will automatically be allowed to proceed. You can choose to [run all builds immediately or limit to one active build per branch](/docs/builds/build-queues#with-on-demand-concurrent-builds).

You can configure this on the project's [**Build and Deployment Settings**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fbuild-and-deployment\&title=Go+to+Build+and+Deployment+Settings) page:

#### \['Dashboard'

1. From your Vercel dashboard, select the project you wish to enable it for.
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar, and go to the **Build and Deployment** section of your [Project Settings](/docs/projects/overview#project-settings).
3. Under **On-Demand Concurrent Builds**, select one of the following:
   - **Run all builds immediately**: Skip the queue for all builds
   - **Run up to one build per branch**: Limit to one active build per branch
4. The Turbo option is selected by default with 30 vCPUs and 60 GB of memory. You can switch to [Elastic, Enhanced, or Standard build machines](#larger-build-machines) based on your performance and cost goals.
5. Click **Save**.

#### 'cURL'

To create an Authorization Bearer token, see the [access token](/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome#creating-an-access-token) section of the API documentation.

```bash filename="cURL"
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID?teamId=YOUR_TEAM_ID \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "resourceConfig": {
      "elasticConcurrencyEnabled": true,
      "buildQueue": {
        "configuration": "SKIP_NAMESPACE_QUEUE"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Set `configuration` to one of:

- `SKIP_NAMESPACE_QUEUE`: Run all builds immediately
- `WAIT_FOR_NAMESPACE_QUEUE`: Limit to one active build per branch

#### 'SDK']

To create an Authorization Bearer token, see the [access token](/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome#creating-an-access-token) section of the API documentation.

```ts filename="updateProject"
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: '<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>',
});

async function run() {
  const result = await vercel.projects.updateProject({
    idOrName: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    teamId: 'YOUR_TEAM_ID',
    requestBody: {
      resourceConfig: {
        elasticConcurrencyEnabled: true,
        buildQueue: {
          configuration: 'SKIP_NAMESPACE_QUEUE',
        },
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

Set `configuration` to one of:

- `SKIP_NAMESPACE_QUEUE`: Run all builds immediately
- `WAIT_FOR_NAMESPACE_QUEUE`: Limit to one active build per branch

### Force an on-demand build

For individual deployments, you can force build execution using the **Start Building Now** button. Regardless of the reason why this build was queued, it will proceed.

1. Select your project from the [dashboard](/dashboard).

2. in the sidebar, open **Deployments**.

3. Find the queued deployment that you would like to build from the list. You can use the **Status** filter to help find it. You have 2 options:
   - Select the three dots to the right of the deployment and select **Start Building Now**.
   - Click on the deployment list item to go to the deployment's detail page and click **Start Building Now**.

4. **Confirm** that you would like to build this deployment in the **Start Building Now** dialog.

## Optimizing builds

Some other considerations to take into account when optimizing your builds include:

- [Understand](/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#understanding-build-cache) and [manage](/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#managing-build-cache) the build cache. By default, Vercel caches the dependencies of your project, based on your framework, to speed up the build process
- You may choose to [Ignore the Build Step](/docs/project-configuration/project-settings#ignored-build-step) on redeployments if you know that the build step is not necessary under certain conditions
- Use the most recent version of your runtime, particularly Node.js, to take advantage of the latest performance improvements. To learn more, see [Node.js](/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js#default-and-available-versions)

## Prioritize production builds

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Prioritize production builds

If a build has to wait for queued preview deployments to finish, it can delay the production release process. When Vercel queues builds, we'll processes them in chronological order ([FIFO Order](# "FIFO - First In First Out")).

> **💡 Note:** For any new projects created after December 12, 2024, Vercel will prioritize
> production builds by default.

To ensure that changes to the [production environment](/docs/deployments/environments#production-environment) are prioritized over [preview deployments](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) in the queue, you can enable **Prioritize Production Builds**:

1. From your Vercel dashboard, select the project you wish to enable it for
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar, and go to the [**Build and Deployment** section](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fbuild-and-deployment\&title=Prioritize+Production+Builds+Setting) of your [Project Settings](/docs/projects/overview#project-settings)
3. Under **Prioritize Production Builds**, toggle the switch to **Enabled**

## Usage and limits

The on-demand build usage is based on the amount of time it took for a deployment to build when using a concurrent build. In Billing, Elastic build machines are billed by CPU minute. Enhanced and Turbo machines are billed by build minute.

### Pro plan

Build machine usage is priced by machine type. Standard build machines are billed only when on-demand concurrency is enabled. Elastic build machines start at $0.0035 per CPU minute.

| Build machine type | Starting price |
| --- | --- |
| Standard (billed only when On-Demand Concurrent Builds is enabled) | $0.014 |
| Enhanced (always billed) | $0.03 |
| Turbo (always billed) | $0.126 |
| Elastic (always billed, per CPU minute) | $0.0035 |


### Enterprise plan

Elastic build machines start at $0.0035 per CPU minute. Enterprise contract pricing and discounts can vary.

On-demand concurrent builds for Standard, Enhanced, and Turbo build machines are priced in [MIUs](/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice#managed-infrastructure-units-miu) per minute of build time used and the rate depends on the number of contracted concurrent builds and the machine type.

| Concurrent builds contracted | Cost ([MIU](/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice#managed-infrastructure-units-miu) per minute) for Standard build machines | Cost ([MIU](/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice#managed-infrastructure-units-miu) per minute) for Enhanced build machines | Cost ([MIU](/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice#managed-infrastructure-units-miu) per minute) for Turbo build machines |

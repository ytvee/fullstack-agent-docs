# Create a Native Integration

With a , you allow a Vercel customer who has  your integration to use specific features of your integration **without** having them leave the Vercel dashboard and create a separate account on your platform. You can create multiple products for each integration and each integration connects to Vercel through specific categories.

## Requirements

To create and list your products as a Vercel provider, you need to:

- Use a Vercel Team on a [Pro plan](/docs/plans/pro-plan).
- Provide a **Base URL** in the product specification for a native integration server that you will create based on:
  - The [sample integration server repository](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration).
  - The [native integrations API endpoints](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api).
- Be an approved provider so that your product is available in the Vercel Marketplace. To do so, [submit your application](https://vercel.com/marketplace/program#become-a-provider) to the Vercel Marketplace program.

## Create your product

In this tutorial, you create a storage  for your native integration through the following steps:

- ### Set up the integration
  Before you can create a product, you must have an existing integration. [Create a new Native Integration](/docs/integrations/create-integration) or use your existing one.

- ### Deploy the integration server
  In order to deploy the integration server, you should update your integration configuration to set the **base URL** to the integration server URL:
  1. Select the team you would like to use from the team switcher.
  2. From your [dashboard](/dashboard), open [**Integrations**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fintegrations\&title=Go+to+Integrations) in the sidebar and then select the **Integrations Console** button.
  3. Select the integration you would like to use for the product.
  4. Find the **base URL** field in the **Product** section and set it to the integration server URL.
  5. Select **Update**.
  You can use this [example Next.js application](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration) as a guide to create your&#x20;

- ### Add a new product
  1. Select the integration you would like to use for the product from the Integrations Console
  2. Select **Create Product** from the **Products** card of the **Product** section

- ### Complete the fields and save
  You should now see the **Create Product** form. Fill in the following fields:
  1. Complete the **Name**, **URL Slug**, **Visibility** and **Short Description** fields
  2. Optionally toggle **Disable Resource Renaming** to prevent customers from renaming resources after creation. By default, customers can rename resources. Enable this if your platform requires resource names to remain unchanged after provisioning.
  3. Optionally update the following in the [Metadata Schema](#metadata-schema) field:
  - Edit the `properties` of the JSON schema to match the options that you are making available through the .
  - Edit and check that the attributes of each property such as `type` matches your requirements.
  - Include the billing plan options that Vercel will send to your integration server when requesting the list of billing plans.
  - Use the **** section to check your JSON schema as you update it.
  Review the data collection process shown in the [submit store creation flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#submit-store-creation) to understand the impact of the metadata schema.
  4. Select **Apply Changes**

- ### Update your integration server
  Add or update the [Billing](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#billing) endpoints in your integration server so that the appropriate plans are pulled from your backend when Vercel calls these endpoints. Review the [marketplace integration example](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration/blob/main/app/v1/products/%5BproductId%5D/plans/route.ts) for a sample billing plan route.

  Your integration server needs to handle the [billing plan selection flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#select-billing-plan) and [resource provisioning flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#submit-store-creation).

- ### Publish your product
  To publish your product, you'll need to request for the new product to be approved:
  1. Check that your product integration follows our [review guidelines](/docs/integrations/create-integration/approval-checklist)
  2. Email integrations@vercel.com with your request to be reviewed for listing
  Once approved, Vercel customers can now add your product with the integration and select a billing plan.

## Reference

### Metadata schema

When you first create your , you will see a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) in the **Metadata Schema** field of the product configuration options. You will edit this schema to match the options you want to make available in the Vercel integration dashboard to the customer who installs this product integration.

When the customer installs your product, Vercel collects data from this customer and sends it to your  based on the Metadata schema you provided in the  configuration. The schema includes properties specific to Vercel that allow the Vercel dashboard to understand how to render the user interface to collect this data from the customer.

As an example, use the following configuration to only show the name of the product:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": []
}
```

See the endpoints for [Provision](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#provision-resource) or [Update](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#update-resource)  for specific examples.

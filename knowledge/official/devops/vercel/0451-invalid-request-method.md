# INVALID_REQUEST_METHOD

The `INVALID_REQUEST_METHOD` error occurs when a request is made with a method that is either invalid or not supported by the server. This error typically happens when trying to use an HTTP method that the endpoint does not accept or recognize.

**Error Code:** `405`

**Name:** Method Not Allowed

## Troubleshoot

To troubleshoot this error, follow these steps:

1. **Verify request method:** Ensure that the HTTP request method used is correct and supported by the endpoint. Common HTTP methods include `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc
2. **Review code:** Check the code where the request is being made to ensure the correct method is being used
3. **Test with different methods:** If possible, test the endpoint with different HTTP methods to determine if the issue is with the method or another part of the request

# CLI Workflows

These workflows show how to compose multiple Vercel CLI commands into complete work sessions. Each workflow walks through a real task from start to finish, including the reasoning between steps.

Workflows are distributed throughout the docs, colocated with the features they use. This page links to all available workflows.

## Debugging and recovery

| Workflow                                                                                 | Description                                                                              | Entry point   |

## Agent quickstarts

These guides help you delegate code-generation tasks to a coding agent like Claude Code, Cursor, or Cline. Each one provides prompts you can copy into your agent to scaffold a full integration.

| Guide                                                                              | Description                                                                   | Entry point         |

| [Sign in with Vercel agent quickstart](/docs/sign-in-with-vercel/agent-quickstart) | Scaffold the full OAuth flow with PKCE, token handling, and a profile page    | Sign in with Vercel |
| [Routing Middleware agent quickstart](/docs/routing-middleware/agent-quickstart)   | Create routing middleware for redirects, auth checks, or geolocation rewrites | Routing Middleware  |

## How these workflows help AI agents

These workflows are designed as composition patterns. Each one shows a complete sequence of CLI commands with the reasoning that connects them. AI coding agents can use these patterns to:

- Learn when to reach for each Vercel CLI command
- Understand the investigation flow for common problems
- Compose commands into multi-step sessions for novel situations
- Follow the same debugging methodology that experienced Vercel users follow

# Audit Logs

> **Permissions Required**: Audit Logs

Audit logs help you track and analyze your [team members'](/docs/rbac/managing-team-members) activity. They can be accessed by team members with the [owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) role, and are available to customers on [enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) plans.

## Export audit logs

To export and download audit logs:

- Go to **Team Settings** > [**Security & Privacy**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fsecurity&title=Go+to+Security+settings) > **Audit Log**
- Select a timeframe to export a Comma Separated Value ([CSV](#audit-logs-csv-file-structure)) file containing all events occurred during that time period
- Click the **Export CSV** button to download the file

The team owner requesting an export will then receive an email with a link containing the report. This link is used to access the report and is valid for 24 hours.

Reports generated for the last 90 days (three months) will not impact your billing.

## Custom SIEM Log Streaming

> **Permissions Required**: Custom SIEM Log Streaming

In addition to the standard audit log functionalities, Vercel supports custom log streaming to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system of choice. This allows you to integrate Vercel audit logs with your existing observability and security infrastructure.

We support the following SIEM options out of the box:

- AWS S3
- Splunk
- Datadog
- Google Cloud Storage

We also support streaming logs to any HTTP endpoint, secured with a custom header.

### Allowlisting IP addresses

If your SIEM requires IP allowlisting, please use the following IP addresses:

```3.217.146.166
23.21.184.92
34.204.154.149
44.213.245.178
44.215.236.82
50.16.203.9
52.1.251.34
52.21.49.187
174.129.36.47
```

### Setup process

To set up custom log streaming to your SIEM:

- From your [dashboard](/dashboard), go to **Team Settings**, open [**Security & Privacy**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fsecurity&title=Go+to+Security+settings) in the sidebar, and scroll to **Audit Log**
- Click the **Configure** button
- Select one of the supported SIEM providers and follow the step-by-step guide

The HTTP POST provider is generic solution to stream audit logs to any configured endpoint. To set this up, you need to provide:

- **URL:** The endpoint that will accept HTTP POST requests
- **HTTP Header Name:** The name of the header, such as `Authorization`
- **HTTP Header Value:** The corresponding value, e.g. `Bearer <token>`

For the request body format, you can choose between:

- **JSON:** Sends a JSON array containing event objects
- **NDJSON:** Sends events as newline-delimited JSON objects, enabling individual processing

### Audit Logs CSV file structure

The CSV file can be opened using any spreadsheet-compatible software, and includes the following fields:

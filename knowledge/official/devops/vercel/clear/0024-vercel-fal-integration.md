# Vercel fal Integration

enables the
development of real-time AI applications with a focus on rapid inference speeds,
achieving response times under ~120ms. Specializing in diffusion models, fal has
no cold starts and a pay-for-what-you-use pricing model.

## Use cases

You can use the [Vercel and fal integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/fal) to power a variety of AI applications, including:

- **Text-to-image applications**: Use fal to integrate real-time text-to-image generation in applications, enabling users to create complex visual content from textual descriptions instantly
- **Real-time image processing**: Use fal for applications requiring instantaneous image analysis and modification, such as real-time filters, enhancements, or object recognition in streaming video
- **Depth maps creation**: Use fal's AI models for generating depth maps from images, supporting applications in 3D modeling, augmented reality, or advanced photography editing, where understanding the spatial relationships in images is crucial

### Available models

fal provides a diverse range of AI models designed for high-performance tasks in image and text processing.

## Getting started

The Vercel  integration can be accessed through the **AI** tab on your [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard).

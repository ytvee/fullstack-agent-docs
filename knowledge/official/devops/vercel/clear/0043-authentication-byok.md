# Authentication & BYOK

Every request to AI Gateway requires authentication. Vercel provides two methods: API keys and OIDC tokens. You can also bring your own provider credentials to use existing agreements or access private features.

## Quick start

Get authenticated in under a minute:

1. Go to the [AI Gateway API Keys page](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai-gateway%2Fapi-keys&title=AI+Gateway+API+Keys) in your Vercel dashboard
2. Click **Create key** and follow the steps to generate a new API key.
3. Copy the API key and add it to your environment:

```bash
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

The [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) automatically uses this environment variable for authentication.
If you are using a different SDK, you may need to pass the API key manually.

## Authentication methods

### API keys

API keys work anywhere, whether it's local development, external servers, or CI pipelines. Create them in the [AI Gateway page](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai-gateway&title=AI+Gateway) and they never expire unless you revoke them.

### OIDC tokens

For applications deployed on Vercel, OIDC tokens are automatically available as `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`. No secrets to manage, no keys to rotate. It just works.

```typescript
// Automatically uses OIDC on Vercel, falls back to API key locally
const apiKey = process.env.AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY || process.env.VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN;
```

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

BYOK lets you use your own provider credentials. This is useful when you:

- **Have existing agreements**: Use enterprise pricing or credits from providers
- **Need zero markup**: BYOK requests have no additional fee
- **Require private access**: Access provider features that need your own credentials
- **Want automatic fallback**: If your credentials fail, requests can retry with system credentials

BYOK credentials are configured at the team level and work across all projects. See the [BYOK documentation](/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok/byok) for setup instructions.

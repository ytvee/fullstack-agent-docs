# Vercel Perplexity Integration

specializes in providing
accurate, real-time answers to user questions by combining AI-powered search
with large language models, delivering concise, well-sourced, and conversational
responses. Integrating Perplexity via its [Sonar
API](https://sonar.perplexity.ai/) with Vercel allows your applications to
deliver real-time, web-wide research and question-answering
capabilities—complete with accurate citations, customizable sources, and
advanced reasoning—enabling users to access up-to-date, trustworthy information
directly within your product experience.

## Use cases

You can use the Vercel and Perplexity integration to power a variety of AI applications, including:

- **Real-time, citation-backed answers:** Integrate Perplexity to provide users with up-to-date information grounded in live web data, complete with detailed source citations for transparency and trust.
- **Customizable search and data sourcing:** Tailor your application's responses by specifying which sources Perplexity should use, ensuring compliance and relevance for your domain or industry.
- **Complex, multi-step query handling:** Leverage advanced models like Sonar Pro to process nuanced, multi-part questions, deliver in-depth research, and support longer conversational context windows.
- **Optimized speed and efficiency:** Benefit from Perplexity's lightweight, fast models that deliver nearly instant answers at scale, making them ideal for high-traffic or cost-sensitive applications.
- **Fine-grained output control:** Adjust model parameters (e.g., creativity, repetition) and manage output quality to align with your application's unique requirements and user expectations.

# Anatomy of the Checks API

Checks API extends the build and deploy process once your deployment is ready. Each check behaves like a webhook that triggers specific events, such as `deployment.created`, `deployment.ready`, and `deployment.succeeded`. The test are verified before domains are assigned.

To learn more, see the [Supported Webhooks Events docs](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#supported-event-types).

The workflow for registering and running a check is as follows:

1. A check is created after the `deployment.created` event
2. When the `deployment.ready` event triggers, the check updates its `status` to `running`
3. When the check is finished, the `status` updates to `completed`

If a check is "rerequestable", your integration users get an option to [rerequest and rerun the failing checks](#rerunning-checks).

### Types of Checks

Depending on the type, checks can block the domain assignment stage of deployments.

- **Blocking Checks**: Prevents a successful deployment and returns a `conclusion` with a `state` value of `canceled` or `failed`. For example, a [Core Check](/docs/observability/checks-overview#types-of-flows-enabled-by-checks-api) returning a `404` error results in a `failed` `conclusion` for a deployment
- **Non-blocking Checks**: Return test results with a successful deployment regardless of the `conclusion`

A blocking check with a `failed` state is configured by the developer (and not the integration).

### Associations

Checks are always associated with a specific deployment that is tested and validated.

| `detailsUrl`    | String (optional)  | URL to display in the Vercel dashboard                                                                                                                                                               |

| `rerequestable` | Boolean (optional) | Tells Vercel if the check can rerun. Users can trigger a `deployment.check-rerequested` [webhook](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment.check-rerequested), through a button on the deployment page |
| `conclusion`    | String (optional)  | The result of a running check. For [blocking checks](#types-of-checks) the values can be `canceled`, `failed`, `neutral`, `succeeded`, `skipped`. `canceled` and `failed`                            |
| `status`        | String (optional)  | Tells Vercel the status of the check with values: `running` and `completed`                                                                                                                          |
| `output`        | Object (optional)  | Details about the result of the check. Vercel uses this data to display actionable information for developers. This helps them debug failed checks                                                   |

The check gets a `stale` status if there is no status update for more than one hour (`status = registered`). The same applies if the check is running (`status = running`) for more than five minutes.

### Output

The `output` property can store any data like [Web Vitals](/docs/speed-insights) and [Virtual Experience Score](/docs/speed-insights/metrics#predictive-performance-metrics-with-virtual-experience-score). It is defined under a `metrics` field:

### Metrics

`metrics` makes [Web Vitals](/docs/speed-insights) visible on checks. It is defined inside `output` as follows:

```json filename="checks-metrics.json"
{
  "path": "/",
  "output": {
    "metrics": {
        "FCP": {
          "value": 1200,
          "previousValue": 1400,
          "source": "web-vitals"
        }
        "LCP": {
          "value": 1200,
          "previousValue": 1400,
          "source": "web-vitals"
        },
        "CLS": {
          "value": 1200,
          "previousValue": 1400,
          "source": "web-vitals"
        },
        "TBT": {
          "value": 1200,
          "previousValue": 1400,
          "source": "web-vitals"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **💡 Note:** All fields are required except `previousValue`. If
> `previousValue` is present, the delta will be shown.

### Rerunning checks

A check can be "rerequested" using the `deployment.check-rerequested` webhook. Add the `rerequestable` attribute, and you can rerequest failed checks.

A rerequested check triggers the`deployment.check-rerequested` webhook. It updates the check `status` to `running` and resets the `conclusion`, `detailsUrl`, `externalId`, and `output` fields.

### Skipping Checks

You can "Skip" to stop and ignore check results without affecting the alias assignment. You cannot skip active checks. They continue running until built successfully, and assign domains as the last step.

### Availability of URLs

For "Running Checks", only the [Automatic Deployment URL](/docs/deployments/generated-urls) is available. [Automatic Branch URL](/docs/deployments/generated-urls#generated-from-git) and [Custom Domains](/docs/domains/add-a-domain) will apply once the checks finish.

### Order of execution

Checks may take different times to run. Each integrator determines the running order of the checks. While [Vercel REST API](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations) determines the order of check results.

### Status and conclusion

When Checks API begins running on your deployment, the `status` is set to `running`. Once it gets a `conclusion`, the `status` updates to `completed`. This results in a successful deployment.

However, your deployment will fail if the `conclusion` updates to one of the following values:

| Conclusion  | `blocking=true` |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| `canceled`  | Yes             |
| `failed`    | Yes             |
| `neutral`   | No              |
| `succeeded` | No              |
| `skipped`   | No              |

# Agent Skills

An agent skill is a packaged capability that extends an AI agent with a specific, production ready behavior such as data access, automation, or domain logic. Skills give agents secure, structured ways to take action across your stack, so they can move beyond chat and reliably execute real workflows. They are modular, composable, and built to plug directly into modern web infrastructure.

Below you'll find the official directory of Vercel published skills. Each skill is verified, documented, and ready to integrate, so you can quickly add powerful new capabilities to your agents and ship faster with confidence.

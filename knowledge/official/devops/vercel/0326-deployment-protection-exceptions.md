# Deployment Protection Exceptions

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Deployment Protection Exceptions

Deployment Protection Exceptions let you disable Deployment Protection (including [Vercel Authentication](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication), [Password Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection), and [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips)) for a list of preview domains.

When you add a domain to Deployment Protection Exceptions, it becomes publicly accessible and is no longer covered by Deployment Protection features. When you remove a domain from Deployment Protection Exceptions, the domain becomes protected again with the project's Deployment Protection settings.

Deployment Protection Exceptions is designed for Preview Deployment domains. If you wish to make a Production Deployment domain public, see [Configuring Deployment Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection#configuring-deployment-protection).

# Framework environment variables

Frameworks typically use a prefix in order to expose environment variables to the browser.

The following prefixed environment variables will be available during the **build step**, based on the project's selected [framework preset](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#framework-preset).

## Using prefixed framework environment variables locally

Many frontend frameworks require prefixes on environment variable names to make them available to the client, such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for Next.js or `PUBLIC_` for SvelteKit. Vercel adds these prefixes automatically for your production and preview deployments, **but not for your local development environment**.

**Framework environment variables are not prefixed when pulled into your local development environment with `vercel env pull`**. For example, `VERCEL_ENV` will not be prefixed to `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`.

To use framework-prefixed environment variables locally:

1. [Define them in your project settings](/docs/environment-variables#creating-environment-variables) with the appropriate prefix
2. Scope them to `Development`
3. Pull them into your local environment with Vercel CLI using the `vercel env pull` command

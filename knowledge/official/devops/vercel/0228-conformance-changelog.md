### `1.7.0`

This minor update captures and sends Conformance runs metrics to Vercel.
Your team will be able to view those metrics in the Vercel dashboard.

The following rules also include these fixes:

- [`NEXTJS_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_DYNAMIC`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_DYNAMIC):
  Improved error messaging.
- [`NEXTJS_SAFE_NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_USAGE`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_SAFE_NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_USAGE):
  Improved error messaging.

### `1.6.0`

This minor update introduces multiple new rules, fixes and improvements for
existing rules and the CLI, and updates to some dependencies for performance
and security.

Notably, this release introduces a new `needsResolution` flag. This is used
by the CLI and will be used in future metrics as a mechanism to opt-out of
further tracking of this issue.

The following new rules have been added:

- [`NO_UNNECESSARY_PROP_SPREADING`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_UNNECESSARY_PROP_SPREADING):
  Disallows the usage of object spreading in JSX components.

The following rules had fixes and improvements:

- [`REQUIRE_CARET_DEPENDENCIES`](/docs/conformance/rules/REQUIRE_CARET_DEPENDENCIES):
  Additional cases are now covered by this rule.
- [`NO_INSTANCEOF_ERROR`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_INSTANCEOF_ERROR):
  Multiple issues in the same file are no longer reported as a single issue.
- [`NO_INLINE_SVG`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_INLINE_SVG):
  Multiple issues in the same file are no longer reported as a single issue.
- [`REQUIRE_ONE_VERSION_POLICY`](/docs/conformance/rules/REQUIRE_ONE_VERSION_POLICY):
  Multiple issues in the same file are now differentiated by the package name
  and the location of the entry in `package.json`.

### `1.5.0`

This minor update introduces a new rule and improvements to our telemetry.

The following new rules have been added:

- [`NO_INSTANCEOF_ERROR`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_INSTANCEOF_ERROR):
  Disallows using `error instanceof Error` comparisons due to risk of false negatives.

### `1.4.0`

This minor update introduces multiple new rules, fixes and improvements for
existing rules and the CLI, and updates to some dependencies for performance
and security.

The following new rules have been added:

- [`NEXTJS_SAFE_NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_USAGE`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_SAFE_NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_USAGE):
  Requires allowlist entries for any usage of `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables.
- [`NO_POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT):
  Prevents the use of `"postinstall"` script in package for performance reasons.
- [`REQUIRE_CARET_DEPENDENCIES`](/docs/conformance/rules/REQUIRE_CARET_DEPENDENCIES):
  Requires that all `dependencies` and `devDependencies` have a `^` prefix.

The following rules had fixes and improvements:

- [`PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT_REQUIRED_README`](/docs/conformance/rules/PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT_REQUIRED_README):
  Lowercase `readme.md` files are now considered valid.
- [`REQUIRE_NODE_VERSION_FILE`](/docs/conformance/rules/REQUIRE_NODE_VERSION_FILE):
  Resolved an issue preventing this rule from correctly reporting issues.
- [`NO_INLINE_SVG`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_INLINE_SVG):
  Detection logic now handles template strings alongside string literals.
- The [`forbidden-imports`](/docs/conformance/custom-rules/forbidden-imports)
  custom rule type now supports `paths` being defined in [rule configuration](/docs/conformance/custom-rules/forbidden-imports#configuring-this-rule-type).

### `1.3.0`

This minor update introduces new rules to improve Next.js app performance,
resolves an issue where TypeScript's `baseUrl` wasn't respected when traversing
files, and fixes an issue with dependency traversal which caused some rules to
return false positives in specific cases.

The following new rules have been added:

- [`NEXTJS_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_DYNAMIC`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_DYNAMIC):
  Requires explicitly setting the `dynamic` route segment option for Next.js pages and routes.
- [`NO_INLINE_SVG`](/docs/conformance/rules/NO_INLINE_SVG):
  Prevents the use of `svg` tags inline, which can negatively impact the
  performance of both browser and server rendering.

### `1.2.1`

This patch updates some Conformance dependencies for performance and security,
and improves handling of edge case for both [`NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_LAYOUT`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_LAYOUT)
and [`NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_PAGE`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_PAGE).

### `1.2.0`

This minor update introduces a new rule, and improvements to both
`NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_LAYOUT` and `NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_PAGE`.

The following new rules have been added:

- [`REQUIRE_NODE_VERSION_FILE`](/docs/conformance/rules/REQUIRE_NODE_VERSION_FILE):
  Requires that workspaces have a valid Node.js version file (`.node-version` or `.nvmrc`) file defined.

### `1.1.0`

This minor update introduces new rules to improve Next.js app performance,
enhancements to the CLI output, and improvements to our telemetry. While
telemetry improvements are not directly user-facing, they enhance our ability
to monitor and optimize performance.

The following new rules have been added:

- [`NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_PAGE`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_PAGE):
  Ensures that the exported Next.js page component and its transitive dependencies are not asynchronous,
  as that blocks the rendering of the page.
- [`NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_LAYOUT`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_NO_ASYNC_LAYOUT):
  Ensures that the exported Next.js layout component and its transitive dependencies are not asynchronous,
  as that can block the rendering of the layout and the rest of the page.
- [`NEXTJS_USE_NATIVE_FETCH`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_USE_NATIVE_FETCH):
  Requires using native `fetch` which Next.js polyfills, removing the need for
  third-party fetch libraries.
- [`NEXTJS_USE_NEXT_FONT`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_USE_NEXT_FONT):
  Requires using `next/font` (when possible), which optimizes fonts for
  improved privacy and performance.
- [`NEXTJS_USE_NEXT_IMAGE`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_USE_NEXT_IMAGE):
  Requires that `next/image` is used for all images for improved performance.
- [`NEXTJS_USE_NEXT_SCRIPT`](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_USE_NEXT_SCRIPT):
  Requires that `next/script` is used for all scripts for improved performance.

### `1.0.0`

# Domain management for multi-tenant

Learn how to programmatically manage domains for your multi-tenant application using Vercel for Platforms.

## Using wildcard domains

If you plan on offering subdomains like `*.acme.com`, add a **wildcard domain** to your Vercel project. This requires using [Vercel's nameservers](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/working-with-nameservers) so that Vercel can manage the DNS challenges necessary for generating wildcard SSL certificates.

1. Point your domain to Vercel's nameservers (`ns1.vercel-dns.com` and `ns2.vercel-dns.com`).
2. In your Vercel project settings, add the apex domain (e.g., `acme.com`).
3. Add a wildcard domain: `.acme.com`.

Now, any `tenant.acme.com` you create—whether it's `tenant1.acme.com` or `docs.tenant1.acme.com`—automatically resolves to your Vercel deployment. Vercel issues individual certificates for each subdomain on the fly.

## Offering custom domains

You can also give tenants the option to bring their own domain. In that case, you'll want your code to:

1. Provision and assign the tenant's domain to your Vercel project.
2. Verify the domain (to ensure the tenant truly owns it).
3. Automatically generate an SSL certificate.

## Adding a domain programmatically

You can add a new domain through the [Vercel SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/sdk). For example:

```ts
import { VercelCore as Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk/core.js';
import { projectsAddProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsAddProjectDomain.js';

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: process.env.VERCEL_TOKEN,
});

// The 'idOrName' is your project name in Vercel, for example: 'multi-tenant-app'
await projectsAddProjectDomain(vercel, {
  idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
  teamId: 'team_1234',
  requestBody: {
    // The tenant's custom domain
    name: 'customacmesite.com',
  },
});
```

Once the domain is added, Vercel attempts to issue an SSL certificate automatically.

## Verifying domain ownership

If the domain is already in use on Vercel, the user needs to set a TXT record to prove ownership of it.

You can check the verification status and trigger manual verification:

```ts
import { VercelCore as Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk/core.js';
import { projectsGetProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsGetProjectDomain.js';
import { projectsVerifyProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsVerifyProjectDomain.js';

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: process.env.VERCEL_TOKEN,
});

const domain = 'customacmesite.com';

const [domainResponse, verifyResponse] = await Promise.all([
  projectsGetProjectDomain(vercel, {
    idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
    teamId: 'team_1234',
    domain,
  }),
  projectsVerifyProjectDomain(vercel, {
    idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
    teamId: 'team_1234',
    domain,
  }),
]);

const { value: result } = verifyResponse;

if (!result?.verified) {
  console.log(`Domain verification required for ${domain}.`);
  // You can prompt the tenant to add a TXT record or switch nameservers.
}
```

## Handling redirects and apex domains

### Redirecting between apex and "www"

Some tenants might want `www.customacmesite.com` to redirect automatically to their apex domain `customacmesite.com`, or the other way around.

1. Add both `customacmesite.com` and `www.customacmesite.com` to your Vercel project.
2. Configure a redirect for `www.customacmesite.com` to the apex domain by setting `redirect: customacmesite.com` through the API or your Vercel dashboard.

This ensures a consistent user experience and prevents issues with duplicate content.

### Avoiding duplicate content across subdomains

If you offer both `tenant.acme.com` and `customacmesite.com` for the same tenant, you may want to redirect the subdomain to the custom domain (or vice versa) to avoid search engine duplicate content. Alternatively, set a canonical URL in your HTML `<head>` to indicate which domain is the "official" one.

## Deleting or removing domains

If a tenant cancels or no longer needs their custom domain, you can remove it from your Vercel account using the SDK:

```ts
import { VercelCore as Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk/core.js';
import { projectsRemoveProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsRemoveProjectDomain.js';
import { domainsDeleteDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/domainsDeleteDomain.js';

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: process.env.VERCEL_TOKEN,
});

await Promise.all([
  projectsRemoveProjectDomain(vercel, {
    idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
    teamId: 'team_1234',
    domain: 'customacmesite.com',
  }),
  domainsDeleteDomain(vercel, {
    domain: 'customacmesite.com',
  }),
]);
```

The first call disassociates the domain from your project, and the second removes it from your account entirely.

## Troubleshooting common issues

Here are a few common issues you might run into and how to solve them:

**DNS propagation delays**

After pointing your nameservers to Vercel or adding CNAME records, changes can take 24–48 hours to propagate. Use [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to confirm updates worldwide.

**Forgetting to verify domain ownership**

If you add a tenant's domain but never verify it (e.g., by adding a `TXT` record or using Vercel nameservers), SSL certificates won't be issued. Always check the domain's status in your Vercel project or with the SDK.

**Wildcard domain requires Vercel nameservers**

If you try to add `.acme.com` without pointing to `ns1.vercel-dns.com` and `ns2.vercel-dns.com`, wildcard SSL won't work. Make sure the apex domain's nameservers are correctly set.

**Exceeding subdomain length for preview URLs**

Each DNS label has a [63-character limit](/kb/guide/why-is-my-vercel-deployment-url-being-shortened#rfc-1035). If you have a very long branch name plus a tenant subdomain, the fully generated preview URL might fail to resolve. Keep branch names concise.

**Duplicate content SEO issues**

If the same site is served from both subdomain and custom domain, consider using [canonical](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#alternates) tags or auto-redirecting to the primary domain.

**Misspelled domain**

A small typo can block domain verification or routing, so double-check your domain spelling.

# Provider Timeouts

You can set per-provider timeouts to trigger fast failover when a provider is slow to respond. If a provider doesn't start responding within the configured timeout, AI Gateway aborts the request and falls back to the next available provider.

Use this for latency-sensitive applications where fast failover beats waiting for a slow provider.

> **💡 Note:** Provider timeouts apply to BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) credentials only. Some
> providers don't support stream cancellation, so you may still be charged for
> timed-out requests depending on the provider.

## Set provider timeouts

Use the `providerTimeouts` option in `providerOptions.gateway` to configure timeouts per provider. Values are in milliseconds.

```typescript filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" {9-13}
import { streamText } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { prompt } = await request.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5.4',
    prompt,
    providerOptions: {
      gateway: {
        providerTimeouts: {
          byok: { openai: 15000 }, // 15 seconds
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

In this example, if OpenAI doesn't start responding within 15 seconds using your own API key, AI Gateway aborts the request and tries the next available provider.

## Timeout limits

| Minimum      | Maximum             |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1,000ms (1s) | 789,000ms (~13 min) |

> **💡 Note:** The timeout measures time until the provider starts streaming. Once the first
> token arrives (including thinking tokens from reasoning models), the timeout
> is cleared and won't fire.

## Combine with provider routing

Provider timeouts work with all other [provider options](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/provider-options). Combine them with `order` to control both the provider sequence and failover speed:

```typescript filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" {9-15}
import { streamText } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { prompt } = await request.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4.6',
    prompt,
    providerOptions: {
      gateway: {
        order: ['anthropic', 'bedrock', 'vertex'],
        providerTimeouts: {
          byok: {
            anthropic: 10000,
            bedrock: 15000,
            // no timeout for vertex — uses the default gateway timeout
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

This configuration:

1. Tries Anthropic first with a 10-second timeout
2. If Anthropic is slow, falls back to Bedrock with a 15-second timeout
3. If Bedrock is slow, falls back to Vertex with the default gateway timeout

## Check timeout behavior in response metadata

When a provider times out, the attempt metadata includes `providerTimeout` and `configuredTimeoutMs` fields so you can see exactly what happened:

```json
"attempts": [
  {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "credentialType": "byok",
    "success": false,
    "error": "PROVIDER_TIMEOUT",
    "providerTimeout": true,
    "configuredTimeoutMs": 10000
  },
  {
    "provider": "bedrock",
    "credentialType": "byok",
    "success": true,
    "statusCode": 200
  }
]
```

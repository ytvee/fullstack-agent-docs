# Vercel Groq Integration

&#x20;is a high-performance AI inference
service with an ultra-fast Language Processing Unit (LPU) architecture. It
enables fast response times for language model inference, making it ideal for
applications requiring low latency.

## Use cases

You can use the [Vercel and Groq integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/groq) to:

- Connect AI models such as Whisper-large-v3 for audio processing and Llama models for text generation to your Vercel projects.
- Deploy and run inference with optimized performance.

### Available models

Groq provides a diverse range of AI models designed for high-performance tasks.

## Getting started

The Vercel  integration can be accessed through the **AI** tab on your [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard).

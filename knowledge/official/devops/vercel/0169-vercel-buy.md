# vercel buy

The `vercel buy` command allows you to purchase Vercel products for your team directly from the CLI. You can buy credits, addons, subscriptions, and domains.

> **💡 Note:** All subcommands except `domain` require a team scope. Use `--scope` to
> specify a team if you haven't already.

## Usage

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel buy [subcommand]
```

*Running \`vercel buy\` without a subcommand displays
the help menu.*

## Subcommands

### `credits`

Purchase Vercel credits for your team. Supported credit types are `v0`, `gateway` (AI Gateway), and `agent` (Vercel Agent).

The `amount` argument is specified in whole US dollars. The maximum amount per purchase is $1,000.

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel buy credits [credit-type] [amount]
```

*Using the \`vercel buy credits\` command to purchase
credits for the current team.*

| Argument      | Required | Description                                           |

### `addon`

Purchase a Vercel addon for your team. Your team must be on the Flex plan to purchase addons. Run `vercel buy addon --help` to see all available addon options.

## Unique options

These are options that apply to the `vercel buy credits` and `vercel buy addon` subcommands.

### Yes

The `--yes` option skips the confirmation prompt. This is required when running in non-interactive environments like CI.

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel buy credits v0 100 --yes
```

*Using the \`vercel buy credits\` command with the
\`--yes\` option to skip confirmation.*

### JSON output

The `--json` flag returns the purchase result as JSON instead of plain text.

```bash filename="terminal"
vercel buy credits gateway 250 --json
```

*Using the \`vercel buy credits\` command with the
\`--json\` option for structured output.*

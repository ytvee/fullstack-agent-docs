# Notifications

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Notifications

Vercel sends configurable notifications to you through the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard\&title=Open+Dashboard) and email. These notifications enable you to view and manage important alerts about your [deployments](/docs/deployments), [domains](/docs/domains), [integrations](/docs/integrations), [account](/docs/accounts), and [usage](/docs/limits/usage).

## Receiving notifications

There are a number of places where you can receive notifications:

- **Web**: The Vercel dashboard displays a popover, which contains all relevant notifications
- **Email**: You'll receive an email when any of the alerts that you set on your team have been triggered
- **Push**: You'll receive a push notification when any of the alerts that you set on your team have been triggered
- **SMS**: SMS notifications can only be configured on a per-user basis for [Spend Management](/docs/spend-management#managing-alert-threshold-notifications) notifications.

By default, you will receive both web and email notifications for all [types of alerts](#types-of-notifications). Push notifications are opt-in per device and are available on desktop and mobile web. You can [manage these notifications](#managing-notifications) from the **Settings** section in the sidebar, but any changes you make will only affect *your* notifications.

## Basic capabilities

There are two main ways to interact with web notifications:

- **Read**: Unread notifications are displayed with a counter on the bell icon. When you view a notification on the web, it will be marked as read once you close the popover. Because of this, we also will not send an email if you have already read it on the web.
- **Archive**: You can manage the list of notifications by archiving them. You can view these archived notifications in the archive tab, where they will be visible for 365 days.

## Managing notifications

You can manage **your own** notifications by using the following steps:

1. Select your team from the team switcher.
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar and under **Account**, select [**My Notifications**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fnotifications\&title=Go+to+Notifications+settings).
3. From here, you can toggle [where](#receiving-notifications) *you* would like to receive notifications for each different [type of notification](#types-of-notifications).

Any changes you make will only be reflected for your notifications and not for any other members of the team. You cannot configure notifications for other users.

### Notifications for Comments

You can receive feedback on your deployments with the Comments feature. When someone leaves a comment, you'll receive a notification on Vercel. You can see all new comments in the **Comments** section in your notifications sidebar.

[Learn more in the Comments docs](/docs/comments/managing-comments#notifications).

### On-demand usage notifications

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Customizing on-demand usage notifications

You'll receive notifications as you accrue usage past the [included amounts](/docs/limits#included-usage) for products like Vercel Functions, Image Optimization, and more.

**Team owners** on the **Pro** plan can customize which usage categories they want to receive notifications for based on percentage thresholds or absolute dollar values.

Emails are sent out at specific usage thresholds which vary based on the feature and plan you are on.

> **💡 Note:** If you choose to disable notifications, you won't receive alerts for any
> excessive charges within that category. This may result in unexpected
> additional costs on your bill. It is recommended that you carefully consider
> the implications of turning off notifications for any usage thresholds before
> making changes to your notification settings.

## Types of notifications

The types of notifications available for you to manage depend on the [role](/docs/rbac/access-roles/team-level-roles) you are assigned within your team. For example, someone with a [Developer](/docs/rbac/access-roles#developer-role) role will only be able to be notified of Deployment failures and Integration updates.

### Critical notifications

It is *not* possible to disable all notifications for alerts that are critical to your Vercel workflow. You **can** opt-out of [one specific channel](#receiving-notifications), like email, but not both email and web notifications. This is because of the importance of these notifications for using the Vercel platform. The list below provides information on which alerts are critical.

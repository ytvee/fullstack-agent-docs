# Fair Use Guidelines

All subscription plans include usage that is subject to these fair use guidelines. Below is a rule-of-thumb for determining which projects fall within our definition of "fair use" and which do not.

### Examples of fair use

### Never fair use

## Usage guidelines

As a guideline for our community, we expect most users to fall within the below ranges for each plan. We will notify you if your usage is an outlier. Our goal is to be as permissive as possible while not allowing an unreasonable burden on our infrastructure. Where possible, we'll reach out to you ahead of any action we take to address unreasonable usage and work with you to correct it.

### Typical monthly usage guidelines

For Teams on the Pro plan, you can pay for [additional usage](/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines#additional-resources) as you go.

### Other guidelines

**Middleware with the `edge` runtime configured CPU Limits** - Middleware with the `edge` runtime configured can use no more than **50ms of CPU time on average**. This limitation refers to the actual net CPU time, not the execution time. For example, when you are blocked from talking to the network, the time spent waiting for a response does not count toward CPU time limitations.

For [on-demand concurrent builds](/docs/builds/managing-builds#on-demand-concurrent-builds), there is a fair usage limit of 500 concurrent builds per team. If you exceed this limit, any new on-demand build request will be queued until your total concurrent builds goes below 500.

### Additional resources

For members of our **Pro** plan, we offer a pay-as-you-go model for additional usage, giving you greater flexibility and control over your usage. The typical monthly usage guidelines above are still applicable, while extra usage will be automatically charged at the following rates:

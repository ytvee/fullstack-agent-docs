# Vercel Enterprise Managed Infrastructure

Vercel prices its [CDN](/docs/cdn) resources by region to help optimize costs and performance for your projects. This is to ensure you are charged based on the resources used in the region where your project is deployed.

### Managed Infrastructure Units

Managed Infrastructure Units (MIUs) serve as both a financial commitment and a measurement of the infrastructure consumption of an Enterprise project. They are made up of a variety of resources like Fast Data Transfer, Edge Requests, and more.

**MIUs are billed monthly and do not roll over from month to month**.

### Regional pricing

The following table lists the usage amounts for each resource in Managed Infrastructure Units. Resources that depend on the region of your Vercel project are listed according to the region.

Use the dropdown to select the region you are interested in.

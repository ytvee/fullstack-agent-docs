## External Integration Settings

## Redirect URL

- **Required**: Yes

The Redirect URL is an HTTP endpoint that handles the installation process by exchanging a code for an API token, serving a user interface, and managing project connections:

- **Token Exchange**: Exchanges a provided code for a [Vercel REST API access token](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#exchange-code-for-access-token)
- **User Interface**: Displays a responsive UI in a popup window during the installation
- **Project Provisioning**: Allows users to create new projects or connect existing ones in your system to their Vercel Projects
- **Completion**: Redirects the user back to Vercel upon successful installation

**Important considerations**:

- If your application uses the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header, use the value `unsafe-none` to allow the Vercel dashboard to monitor the popup's closed state.
  dashboard to monitor the popup's closed state.
- For local development and testing, you can specify a URL on `localhost`.

## API Scopes

- **Required**: No

API Scopes define the level of access your integration will have to the Vercel REST API. When setting up a new integration, you need to:

- Select only the API Scopes that are essential for your integration to function
- Choose the appropriate permission level for each scope: `None`, `Read`, or `Read/Write`

After activation, your integration may collect specific user data based on the selected scopes. You are accountable for:

- The privacy, security, and integrity of this user data
- Compliance with [Vercel's Shared Responsibility Model](/docs/security/shared-responsibility#shared-responsibilities)

![Image](https://vercel.com/docs-assets/static/docs/integrations/creating/api-scopes-light.png)

Learn more about API scope permissions in the [Extending Vercel](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/manage-integrations-reference) documentation.

## Webhook URL

- **Required**: No

With your integration, you can listen for events on the Vercel platform through Webhooks. The following events are available:

### Deployment events

The following events are available for deployments:

- [`deployment.created`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment.created)
- [`deployment.error`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment.error)
- [`deployment.canceled`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment.canceled)
- [`deployment.succeeded`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment.succeeded)

### Configuration events

The following events are available for configurations:

- [`integration-configuration.permission-upgraded`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#integration-configuration.permission-upgraded)
- [`integration-configuration.removed`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#integration-configuration.removed)
- [`integration-configuration.scope-change-confirmed`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#integration-configuration.scope-change-confirmed)
- [`integration-configuration.transferred`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#integration-configuration.transferred)

### Domain events

The following events are available for domains:

- [`domain.created`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#domain.created)

### Project events

The following events are available for projects:

- [`project.created`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#project.created)
- [`project.removed`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#project.removed)

### Check events

The following events are available for checks:

- [`deployment.ready`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment-ready)
- [`deployment.check-rerequested`](/docs/webhooks/webhooks-api#deployment-check-rerequested)

See the [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) documentation to learn more.

## Configuration URL

- **Required**: No

To allow the developer to configure an installed integration, you can specify a **Configuration URL**. This URL is used for the **Configure** button on each configuration page. Selecting this button will redirect the developer to your specified URL with a `configurationId` query parameter. See [Interacting with Configurations](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#interacting-with-configurations) to learn more.

If you leave the **Configuration URL** field empty, the **Configure** button will default to a **Website** button that links to the website URL you specified on integration settings.

## Marketplace Integration Settings

## Base URL

- **Required: If it's a&#x20;**

The URL that points to the provider's integration server that implements the [Marketplace Provider API](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api). To interact with the provider's application, Vercel makes a request to the base URL appended with the path for the specific endpoint.

For example, if the base url is `https://foo.bar.com/vercel-integration-server`, Vercel makes a `POST` request to something like `https://foo.bar.com/vercel-integration-server/v1/installations`.

## Redirect Login URL

- **Required: If it's a&#x20;**

The URL where Vercel redirect users of the integration in the following situations:

- They open the link to the integration provider's dashboard from the Vercel dashboard as explained in the [Open in Provider button flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#open-in-provider-button-flow)
- They open a specific resource on the Vercel dashboard

This allows providers to automatically log users into their dashboard without asking them to log in.

## Installation-level Billing Plans

- **Required**: No (It's a toggle which is disabled by default)
- Applies to a&#x20;

When enabled, it allows the integration user to select a billing plan for their installation. The default installation-level billing plan is chosen by the partner. When disabled, the installation does not have a configurable billing plan.

### Usage

If the billing for your integration happens at the team, organization or account level, enable this toggle to allow Vercel to fetch the installation-level billing plans. When the user selects an installation-level billing plan, you can then upgrade the plan for this team, account or organization when you provision the product.

The user can update this installation-level plan at any time from the installation detail page of the Vercel dashboard.

## Terms of Service

## Integrations Agreement

- **Required**:
  - **Yes**: If it's a connectable account integration or this is the first time you are creating a native integration
  - **No**: If you are adding a product to the integration. A different agreement may be needed for the first added product

You must agree to the Vercel terms before your integration can be published. The terms may differ depending the type of integration, [connectable account](/docs/integrations/create-integration#connectable-account-integrations) or [native](/docs/integrations#native-integrations).

### Marketplace installation flow

**Usage Scenario**: For installations initiated from the [Vercel Marketplace](/integrations).

- **Post-Installation**: After installation, the user is redirected to a page on your side to complete the setup
- **Completion**: Redirect the user to the provided next URL to close the popup and continue

Make sure to store `configurationId` along with an access token such that if an existing `configurationId` was passed, you could retrieve the corresponding access token.

## Product form fields

### Product Name

It's used as the product card title in the **Products** section of the marketplace integration page.

### Product URL Slug

It's used in the integration console for the url slug of the product's detail page.

### Product Short Description

It's used as the product card description in the **Products** section of the marketplace integration page.

### Product Short Billing Plans Description

It's used as the product card footer description in the **Products** section of the marketplace integration page and should be less than 30 characters.

### Product Metadata Schema

The [metadata schema](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product#metadata-schema) controls the product features such as available regions and CPU size, that you want to allow the Vercel customer to customize in the Vercel integration dashboard. It makes the connection with your [integration server](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration) when the customer interacts with these inputs when creating or updating these properties.

### Product Logo

It's used as the product logo at the top of the Product settings page once the integration user installs this product. If this is not set, the integration logo is used.

### Product Tags

It's used to help integration users filter and group their installed products on the installed integration page.

### Product Guides

You are recommended to include links to get started guides for using your product with specific frameworks. Once your product is added by a Vercel user, these links appear on the product's detail page of the user's Vercel dashboard.

### Product Resource Links

These links appear under the **Resources** left side bar on the product's detail page of the user's Vercel dashboard.

### Support link

Under the **Resources** section, Vercel automatically adds a **Support** link that is a deep link to the provider's dashboard with a query parameter of `support=true` included.

### Product Snippets

These code snippets are designed to be quick starts for the integration user to connect with the installed product with tools such as `cURL` in order to retrieve data and test that their application is working as expected.

You can add up to 6 code snippets to help users get started with your product. These appear at the top of the product's detail page under a **Quickstart** section with a tab for each code block.

You can include secrets in the following way:

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'acme-sdk';

const client = createClient('https://your-project.acme.com', '{{YOUR_SECRET}}');
```

When integration users view your snippet in the Vercel dashboard, `{{YOUR_SECRET}}` is replaced with a `*` accompanied by a **Show Secrets** button. The secret value is revealed when they click the button.

If you're using TypeScript or JavaScript snippets, you can use `{{process.env.YOUR_SECRET}}`. In this case, the snippet view in the Vercel dashboard shows `process.env.YOUR_SECRET` instead of a `*` accompanied by the **Show Secrets** button.

### Edge Config Support

When enabled, integration users can choose an [Edge Config](/docs/edge-config) to access experimentation feature flag data.

### Log Drain Settings

When enabled, the integration user can configure a Log Drain for the Native integration. Once the `Delivery Format` is chosen, the integration user can define the Log Drain `Endpoint` and `Headers`, which can be replaced with the environment variables defined by the integration.

![Image](https://vercel.com/docs-assets/static/docs/integrations/log-drains/logdrain-integration-console-settings-light.png)

### Checks API

When enabled, the integration can use the [Checks API](/docs/checks)

Verify your domain on Cloudflare with Resend.

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<img alt="Domain Details" />

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.
</Tip>

## Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The fastest way to verify your domain on Cloudflare is using the **Sign in to Cloudflare** button on Resend. This uses Domain Connect to automatically configure your DNS records.

1. Go to your [Domains page](https://resend.com/domains) in Resend.
2. (Optional) If you want to receive emails, select `Manual setup` and toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page. ([Learn more below](#receiving-emails))
3. Click **Sign in to Cloudflare** button.
4. Authorize Resend to access your Cloudflare DNS settings.
5. The DNS records will be added automatically.

  `send.example.com`, paste only `send` (or `send.subdomain` if you're using a
  subdomain).

  Do not use the same priority for multiple records. If Priority `10` is already
  in use, try a higher value `20` or `30`.

### Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

Click “Add Record” on Cloudflare:

1. Set the Type to `MX`.
2. Type `inbound` (or whatever your subdomain is) for the `Name` of the record.
3. Copy the MX Value from Resend into the `Mail Server` field.
4. Use the default `Auto` for `TTL`.
5. Add `10` for the `Priority`.
6. Select `Save`.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Cloudflare:


| Cloudflare  | Resend   | Example Value                          |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Type        | Type     | `MX`                                   |
| Name        | Name     | `inbound`                              |
| Mail Server | Content  | `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| Priority    | Priority | `10`                                   |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

### Complete Verification

Now click [Verify DNS Records](https://resend.com/domains) on your Domain in Resend. It may take up to 72 hours to complete the verification process (often much faster).

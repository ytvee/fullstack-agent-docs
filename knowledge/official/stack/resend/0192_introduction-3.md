* **Created** - When the request was made (displayed as relative time)

## Searching Logs

Use the search bar to find specific logs. This is useful when tracking down a particular request or debugging an issue.

## Filtering Logs

Filter logs by response status to quickly identify issues:

You can select multiple status codes to create custom filters.

# Chat SDK Attachments

Source: https://resend.com/docs/chat-sdk-attachments

Handle inbound email attachments with the Chat SDK adapter.

When someone sends an email with file attachments, the adapter makes them available on `message.raw.attachments`. Each attachment includes the filename, MIME type, and a URL to download the content.

## Attachment shape

```ts
interface ResendAttachment {
  filename: string;
  contentType: string;
  url?: string;
}
```

| Field         | Type     | Description                                      |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `filename`    | `string` | Original filename (e.g.,`invoice.pdf`)           |
| `contentType` | `string` | MIME type (e.g.,`application/pdf`)               |
| `url`         | `string` | Optional download URL for the attachment content |

## Detecting and processing attachments

```ts
chat.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  const attachments = message.raw?.attachments ?? [];

  if (attachments.length === 0) {
    await thread.subscribe();
    await thread.post('Got your email — no attachments found.');
    return;
  }

  const summary = attachments
    .map((a) => `${a.filename} (${a.contentType})`)
    .join(', ');

  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post(`Received ${attachments.length} attachment(s): ${summary}`);
});
```

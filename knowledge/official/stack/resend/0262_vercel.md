Verify your domain on Vercel with Resend.

<Note>
  This guide helps you verify your domain on Vercel with Resend. We also have
  [an official integration for
  Vercel](https://resend.com/blog/vercel-integration) that helps you set up your
  API keys on Vercel projects so you can start sending emails with Resend. [View
  the integration here](https://vercel.com/resend/~/integrations/resend).
</Note>

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<img alt="Domain Details" />

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.
</Tip>

## Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The fastest way to verify your domain on Vercel is using the **Auto Configure** button on Resend. This uses Domain Connect to automatically configure your DNS records.

1. Go to your [Domains page](https://resend.com/domains) in Resend.
2. (Optional) If you want to receive emails, select `Manual setup` and toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page. ([Learn more below](#receiving-emails))
3. Click **Auto Configure**.
4. Authorize Resend to access your Vercel DNS settings.
5. The DNS records will be added automatically.

That's it. Your domain will be verified within a few minutes.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to add DNS records manually, follow these steps.

### Log in to Vercel

Log in to your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/login) and select the `Domains` tab.

## Add MX SPF Record

Copy and paste the values in Resend to Vercel.

1. Type `send` for the `Name` of the record in Vercel.
2. Expand the `Type` dropdown and select `MX`.
3. Copy the record value from Resend into the `Value` field in Vercel.
4. Add `10` for the `Priority`.
5. Select `Add`.

  `send.example.com`, paste only `send` (or `send.subdomain` if you're using a
  subdomain).

## Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

Copy and paste the values in Resend to Vercel:

1. Type `inbound` (or whatever your subdomain is) for the `Name` of the record in Vercel.
2. Expand the `Type` dropdown and select `MX`.
3. Copy the MX Value from Resend into the `Value` field in Vercel.
4. Add `10` for the `Priority`.
5. Select `Add`.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Vercel:


| Vercel   | Resend   | Example Value                          |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Type     | Type     | `MX Record`                            |
| Name     | Name     | `inbound`                              |
| Value    | Content  | `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| TTL      | TTL      | `Use Vercel default (60)`              |
| Priority | Priority | `10`                                   |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

## Complete Verification

Now click [Verify DNS Records](https://resend.com/domains) on your Domain in Resend. It may take a few hours to complete the verification process (often much faster).

## Troubleshooting

If your domain is not successfully verified, these are some common troubleshooting methods.

## Product Security

### Penetration testing

Resend engages with third-party firms to conduct penetration testing at least annually.

All areas of the Resend product and cloud infrastructure are in-scope for these assessments, and source code is fully available to the testers in order to maximize the effectiveness and coverage.

You can download the latest penetration test report on the [Documents](https://resend.com/settings/documents) page.

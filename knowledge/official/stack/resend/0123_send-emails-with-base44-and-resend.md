## 2. Add your Resend API key

However you add Resend to your project, you'll need to add a Resend API key, which you can create in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys). Do not share your API key with others or expose it in the browser or other client-side code.

Copy the API key and paste it into the **RESEND\_API\_KEY** field in Base44.

## 3. Add a custom domain to your Resend account

By default, you can only send emails to your own email address.

To send emails to other email addresses:

1. Add a [custom domain to your Resend account](https://resend.com/domains).
2. Add the custom domain to the `from` field in the `resend` function in the Base44 backend function (or ask the chat to update these fields).

Get more help adding a custom domain in [Resend's documentation](/dashboard/domains/introduction).

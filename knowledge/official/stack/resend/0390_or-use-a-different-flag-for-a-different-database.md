</Step>

<Step title="Deploy and register webhook">
Deploy to your preferred platform, then register your webhook endpoint in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/webhooks) and select all the events you'd like to store.

Your endpoint URL will be: `https://your-domain.com/{connector}`

For example: `https://your-app.vercel.app/postgresql`
</Step>
</Steps>

## Database Schemas

The ingester creates three tables to store webhook events:


| Table                | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `resend_wh_emails`   | All email events (sent, delivered, bounced, opened, clicked, etc.) |
| `resend_wh_contacts` | Contact events (created, updated, deleted)                         |
| `resend_wh_domains`  | Domain events (created, updated, deleted)                          |

Each table includes:

* `svix_id` - Unique webhook event ID for idempotency
* `event_type` - The type of event (e.g., `email.delivered`)
* `event_created_at` - When the event occurred
* `webhook_received_at` - When the webhook was received
* Event-specific fields (email details, bounce info, click data, etc.)

## Idempotency

The ingester handles duplicate webhooks automatically. Each webhook includes a unique `svix-id` header, and the ingester uses this to ensure events are stored only once.

If Resend retries a webhook delivery (due to a temporary failure), the duplicate will be safely ignored without creating duplicate records in your database.

## Example Queries

Once your data is stored, you can run analytics queries. Here's an example to get email status counts by day:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sql PostgreSQL theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
  SELECT
    DATE(event_created_at) AS day,
    event_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM resend_wh_emails
  GROUP BY DATE(event_created_at), event_type
  ORDER BY day DESC, event_type;
  ```

```javascript
db.resend_wh_emails.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {
        day: {
          $dateToString: { format: '%Y-%m-%d', date: '$event_created_at' },
        },
        event_type: '$event_type',
      },
      count: { $sum: 1 },
    },
  },
  { $sort: { '_id.day': -1 } },
]);
```
```sql
SELECT
  toDate(event_created_at) AS day,
  event_type,
  count() AS count
FROM resend_wh_emails
FINAL
GROUP BY day, event_type
ORDER BY day DESC, event_type;
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  See the
  [queries\_examples.md](https://github.com/resend/resend-webhooks-ingester/blob/main/queries_examples.md)
  file in the repository for more analytics queries including bounce rates, open
  rates, and click-through rates.
</Info>

## Data Retention

By default, webhook events are stored indefinitely. To implement data retention policies, you can set up scheduled jobs to delete old events.

Example for PostgreSQL (delete events older than 90 days):

```sql
DELETE FROM resend_wh_emails
WHERE event_created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```
<Tip>
  For Supabase, use
  [pg\_cron](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_cron) to
  schedule cleanup queries. For MongoDB, consider using [TTL
  indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-ttl/) or [Atlas
  scheduled
  triggers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/triggers/scheduled-triggers/).
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook signature verification failing">
    * Ensure `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the signing secret in your Resend
      Dashboard - Make sure you're using the raw request body for verification -
      Check that the secret hasn't been rotated in Resend
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database connection errors">
* Verify your database credentials are correct - Check that the schema has
been applied to your database - Ensure your database is accessible from your
deployment (check firewall rules)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhooks not being received">
* Verify your endpoint URL is publicly accessible - Check the webhook status
in your [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/webhooks) - Ensure your server
responds with HTTP 200 for successful requests
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

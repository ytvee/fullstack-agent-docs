# List Received Emails

Source: https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/list-received-emails

GET /emails/receiving
Retrieve a list of received emails for the authenticated user.

You can list all emails received by your team. The list returns references to individual emails. If needed, you can use the `id` of an email to retrieve the email HTML to plain text using the [Retrieve Received Email](/api-reference/emails/retrieve-received-email) endpoint or the [Retrieve Received Attachment](/api-reference/emails/retrieve-received-email-attachment) endpoint to get an email's attachments.

<Info>
  This endpoint only returns emails received by your team. If you need to list
  emails sent by your team, use the [List Sent
  Emails](/api-reference/emails/list-emails) endpoint.

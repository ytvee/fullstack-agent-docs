## SMTP Credentials

When configuring your SMTP integration, you'll need to use the following credentials:

* **Host**: `smtp.resend.com`
* **Port**: `25`, `465`, `587`, `2465`, or `2587`
* **Username**: `resend`
* **Password**: `YOUR_API_KEY`

Ports help to instruct the type of security you want to use in your SMTP connection.


| Type     | Port                | Security                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SMTPS    | `465`, `2465`       | Implicit SSL/TLS (Immediately connects via SSL/TLS)                       |
| STARTTLS | `25`, `587`, `2587` | Explicit SSL/TLS (First connects via plaintext, then upgrades to SSL/TLS) |

## Idempotency Key

Idempotency keys are used to prevent duplicate emails. You can add the `Resend-Idempotency-Key` header to your emails sent with SMTP to prevent duplicate emails.

```yaml
From: Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>
To: delivered@resend.dev
Subject: hello world
Resend-Idempotency-Key: welcome-user/123456789

<p>it works!</p>
```

## Custom Headers

If your SMTP client supports it, you can add custom headers to your emails.

Here are some common use cases for custom headers:

* Prevent threading on Gmail with the `X-Entity-Ref-ID` header
* Include a shortcut for users to unsubscribe with the `List-Unsubscribe` header

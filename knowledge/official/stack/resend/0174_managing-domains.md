## Verifying a domain

Resend sends emails using a domain you own.

We recommend using subdomains (e.g., `updates.yourdomain.com`) to isolate your sending reputation and communicate your intent. Learn more about [using subdomains](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain).

In order to verify a domain, you must set two DNS entries:

1. [SPF](#what-are-spf-records): list of IP addresses authorized to send email on behalf of your domain
2. [DKIM](#what-are-dkim-records): public key used to verify email authenticity

These two DNS entries grant Resend permission to send email on your behalf. Once SPF and DKIM verify, you can optionally add a [DMARC record](/dashboard/domains/dmarc) to build additional trust with mailbox providers.

<Info>
  Resend requires you own your domain (i.e., not a shared or public domain).

## View domain details

The [Domains dashboard](https://resend.com/domains) shows information about your domain name, its verification status, and history.

## What are SPF records

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication standard that allows you to list all the IP addresses that are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain.

The SPF configuration is made of a TXT record that lists the IP addresses approved by the domain owner. It also includes a MX record that allows the recipient to send bounce and complaint feedback to your domain.

## Custom Return Path

By default, Resend will use the `send` subdomain for the Return-Path address. You can change this by setting the optional `custom_return_path` parameter when [creating a domain](/api-reference/domains/create-domain) via the API or under **Advanced options** in the dashboard.

<img alt="Custom Return Path" />

For the API, optionally pass the custom return path parameter.

  ```ts Node.js theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
  import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

resend.domains.create({ name: 'example.com', customReturnPath: 'outbound' });

```

```php PHP theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
$resend = Resend::client('re_xxxxxxxxx');

$resend->domains->create([
  'name' => 'example.com',
  'custom_return_path' => 'outbound'
]);
```
```python
import resend

resend.api_key = "re_xxxxxxxxx"

params: resend.Domains.CreateParams = {
  "name": "example.com",
  "custom_return_path": "outbound"
}

resend.Domains.create(params)
```
```ruby
Resend.api_key = ENV["RESEND_API_KEY"]

params = {
  name: "example.com",
  custom_return_path: "outbound"
}
domain = Resend::Domains.create(params)
puts domain
```
```go
package main

import "github.com/resend/resend-go/v3"

func main() {
	client := resend.NewClient("re_xxxxxxxxx")

	params := &resend.CreateDomainRequest{
		Name:             "example.com",
		CustomReturnPath: "outbound",
	}

	domain, err := client.Domains.Create(params)
}
```
```rust
use resend_rs::{types::CreateDomainOptions, Resend, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
  let resend = Resend::new("re_xxxxxxxxx");

  let _domain = resend
    .domains
    .add(CreateDomainOptions::new("example.com").with_custom_return_path("outbound"))
    .await?;

  Ok(())
}
```
```java
import com.resend.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resend resend = new Resend("re_xxxxxxxxx");

        CreateDomainOptions params = CreateDomainOptions
                .builder()
                .name("example.com")
                .customReturnPath("outbound")
                .build();

        CreateDomainResponse domain = resend.domains().create(params);
    }
}
```
```csharp
using Resend;

IResend resend = ResendClient.Create( "re_xxxxxxxxx" ); // Or from DI

var resp = await resend.DomainAddAsync( new DomainAddData {
   DomainName = "example.com",
   CustomReturnPath = "outbound"
} );
Console.WriteLine( "Domain Id={0}", resp.Content.Id );
```
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/domains' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
  "name": "example.com",
  "custom_return_path": "outbound"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

Custom return paths must adhere to the following rules:

* Must be 63 characters or less
* Must start with a letter, end with a letter or number, and contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens

Avoid setting values that could undermine credibility (e.g. `testing`), as they may be exposed to recipients in some email clients.

## What are DKIM records

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email security standard designed to make sure that an email that claims to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain.

The DKIM configuration is made of a TXT record that contains a public key that is used to verify the authenticity of the email.

## Understand a domain status

Domains can have different statuses, including:

* `not_started`: You've added a domain to Resend, but you haven't clicked on `Verify DNS Records` yet.
* `pending`: Resend is still trying to verify the domain.
* `verified`: Your domain is successfully verified for sending in Resend.
* `partially_verified`: One capability (send or receive) is verified while the other is still pending verification.
* `partially_failed`: The domain is verified but one of the features (send or receive) is not verified.
* `failed`: Resend was unable to detect the DNS records within 72 hours.
* `temporary_failure`: For a previously verified domain, Resend will periodically check for the DNS record required for verification. If at some point, Resend is unable to detect the record, the status would change to "Temporary Failure". Resend will recheck for the DNS record for 72 hours, and if it's unable to detect the record, the domain status would change to "Failure". If it's able to detect the record, the domain status would change to "Verified".

## Export your data

Admins can download your data in CSV format for the following resources:

* Emails
* Broadcasts
* Contacts
* Segments
* Domains
* Logs
* API keys

<Info>Currently, exports are limited to admin users of your team.</Info>

To start, apply filters to your data and click on the "Export" button. Confirm your filters before exporting your data.

<video />

If your exported data includes 1,000 items or less, the export will download immediately. For larger exports, you'll receive an email with a link to download your data.

All admins on your team can securely access the export for 7 days. Unavailable exports are marked as "Expired."

<Note>
  All exports your team creates are listed in the
  [Exports](https://resend.com/exports) page under **Settings** > **Team** >
  **Exports**. Select any export to view its details page. All members of your
  team can view your exports, but only admins can download the data.

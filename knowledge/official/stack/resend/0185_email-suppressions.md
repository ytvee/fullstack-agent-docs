Understanding and resolving delivery issues.

## What does it mean that the email was `suppressed`?

A suppression happens when you try sending an email to a recipient that previously [bounced](/dashboard/emails/email-bounces) or marked your email as spam.

To protect your sender reputation and our sending infrastructure, we proactively stop that delivery from happening.

## What caused the suppression?

The suppression is caused by:

* `Bounced` when the recipient's mail server rejects the email and the response indicates a permanent failure to deliver. There could be [multiple reasons why an email `bounced`](/dashboard/emails/email-bounces#bounce-types-and-subtypes).
* `Complained` when the recipient marked your email as spam.

<Tip>
  Not all Inbox Service Providers return a `complained` event. Most notably,
  Gmail/Google Workspace doesn't.
</Tip>

## Suppression Scope

The suppression list is **per region**. If a recipient bounces or complains when sent from `mail.yourdomain.com`, that address is suppressed for all domains in your region, including `news.yourdomain.com` or any other subdomain.

This means:

* A hard bounce on **any** domain in your region suppresses the address across **all** domains in the region
* A spam complaint from **any** domain suppresses the address region-wide
* Removing an address from the suppression list removes it for all domains in the region

## Viewing Suppression Details in Resend

You can see the suppressed details by clicking on the email, and hovering over the `Suppressed` label.

Once you click **See Details**, the drawer will open on the right side of your screen with the suppression reason along with suggestions on how to proceed.

You can also click **Remove from Suppression List** to prevent the address from being suppressed. Do note that if it bounces or is marked as spam again, it'll be suppressed again. Multiple or repeated bounces will negatively impact your sender reputation.

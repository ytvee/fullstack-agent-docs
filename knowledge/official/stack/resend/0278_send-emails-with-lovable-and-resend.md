# Send emails with Lovable and Resend

Source: https://resend.com/docs/lovable-integration

Learn how to add the Resend integration to your Lovable project.

[Lovable](https://lovable.dev) is a platform for building web sites, tools, apps, and projects via chat. You can add Resend in a Lovable project by asking the chat to add email sending with Resend.

## 1. Add your Resend API key

To use Resend with Lovable, you'll need to add a Resend API key, which you can create in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys). Do not share your API key with others or expose it in the browser or other client-side code.

Lovable may integrate Resend in a few different ways:

* Use the Supabase integration to store the API key **(highly recommended)**
* Ask users to provide their own API key
* Add the API key directly in the code

You may need to prompt Lovable to store the API key for Resend using Supabase. Clicking **Add API key** will open a modal where you can add the API key.

<Info>
  At the time of writing, Lovable does not securely handle API keys
  independently. Instead, it uses the [Supabase integration to store
  secrets](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase#storing-secrets-api-keys-%26-config).

## 2. Add a custom domain to your Resend account

By default, you can only send emails to your own email address.

To send emails to other email addresses:

1. Add a [custom domain to your Resend account](https://resend.com/domains).
2. Add the custom domain to the `from` field in the `resend` function in Lovable (or ask the chat to update these fields).

<Info>
  By default, Lovable deploys using the test domain `resend.dev`. Once your custom domain is verified, the function does not automatically redeploy or update the sender address.

You’ll need to ask Lovable to manually update the `From` email to use your verified domain and then redeploy the function so the changes take effect.

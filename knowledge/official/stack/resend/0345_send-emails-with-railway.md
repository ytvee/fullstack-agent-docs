# Send emails with Railway

Source: https://resend.com/docs/send-with-railway

Learn how to send your first email using Railway and the Resend Node.js SDK.

[Railway](https://railway.com/?referralCode=resend) enables you to focus on building product instead of managing infrastructure, automatically scaling to support your needs as you grow.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:

* [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
* [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

## 1. Install

We've created a [Resend template](https://railway.com/deploy/resend?referralCode=resend\&utm_medium=integration\&utm_source=template\&utm_campaign=generic) using the Resend Node.js SDK as an introduction to using Resend on Railway.

To get started, you deploy the template to Railway.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/resend?referralCode=resend\&utm_medium=integration\&utm_source=template\&utm_campaign=generic)

## 2. Add your API key

[Add an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys) from Resend and click **Deploy**.

## 3. Send your first email

Once your deployment finishes, click the deploy URL to open the app and send your first email.

While this example uses the [Resend Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@resend/node), you can add Resend using [any of our Official SDKs](https://resend.com/docs/sdks) that Railway supports.

<Info>
  Keep in mind that as a basic project, this template sends an email with your
  account each time someone visits your deployment URL, so share the link with
  discretion.

You can also [set up the project locally](https://docs.railway.com/develop/cli) and make changes to the projectusing the Railway CLI.

# Strato

Source: https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/strato

Verify your domain on Strato with Resend.

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<img alt="Domain Details" />

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.
</Tip>

## Log in to Strato

Log in to your [Strato account](https://www.strato.es/apps/CustomerService):

1. In the left-hand navigation, go to Domains > Manage Domain.

## Add MX SPF Record

1. On the domain page, click on the gear icon to redirect to Settings.
2. Create a new subdomain named `send`.
3. Navigate to the subdomain settings.
4. Go to the `DNS` tab, you'll see a list of DNS records you can update. Click on `manage` MX record.
5. Select own mail server.
6. Copy MX value from Resend into `Server` field.
7. Use the default priority `Low`.
8. Save settings.

<Info>
  By default, Strato domains use Strato mail server which uses `mail` as their
  send path. You will need to bypass this default behavior by creating a
  subdomain and setting the MX record there.

## Add TXT SPF Record

On the base domain settings:

1. Go to the `DNS` tab.
2. Manage TXT and CNAME records.
3. On the bottom, click `Create another record`.
4. Choose `TXT` type.
5. Add `send` for the `name` record.
6. For `value` input `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`.
7. Save settings.

<Info>
  Strato provides a standard DMARC record similar to Resend's recommended value:
  `v=DMARC1;p=reject;`.

<Info>
  Omit your domain from the record values in Resend when you paste. Instead of

## Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

1. Create a new subdomain named `inbound` (or whatever your subdomain is).
2. Navigate to the subdomain settings.
3. Go to the `DNS` tab and click on `manage` MX record.
4. Select own mail server.
5. Copy MX value from Resend into `Server` field.
6. Use the default priority `Low`.
7. Save settings.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Strato:


| Strato      | Resend   | Example Value                           |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type        | Type     | `MX Record`                             |
| Name        | Name     | `inbound`                               |
| Mail server | Content  | `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.` |
| Priority    | Priority | `Low`                                   |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

## Complete Verification

Now click [Verify DNS Records](https://resend.com/domains) on your Domain in Resend. It may take a few hours to complete the verification process (often much faster).

## Troubleshooting

If your domain is not successfully verified, these are some common troubleshooting methods.

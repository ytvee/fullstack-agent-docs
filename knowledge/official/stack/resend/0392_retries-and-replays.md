# Retries and Replays

Source: https://resend.com/docs/webhooks/retries-and-replays

Learn how to use the retries and replays to handle webhook failures.

## Automatic Retries

We attempt to deliver each webhook message based on a schedule with exponential backoff.

Each message is attempted based on the following schedule, where each period is started following the failure of the preceding attempt:

* Immediately
* 5 seconds
* 5 minutes
* 30 minutes
* 2 hours
* 5 hours
* 10 hours
* 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

If an endpoint is removed or disabled delivery attempts to the endpoint will be disabled as well.

To see when a message will be retried next, check the webhook message details in the dashboard.

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

## Manual Replays

If a webhook message fails, you can manually replay it.

You can replay both `failed` and `succeeded` webhook messages.

Here's how to replay a webhook message:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://resend.com/webhooks) page
2. Navigate to the Webhook Endpoint you are using
3. Go to the Webhook Message you want to replay
4. Click on the "Replay" button

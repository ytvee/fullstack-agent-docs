# Managing Unsubscribed Contacts

Source: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/audiences/managing-unsubscribe-list

Learn how to check and remove recipients who have unsubscribed to your marketing emails.

It's essential to update your Contact list when someone unsubscribes to maintain a good sender reputation.

Benefits of managing your unsubscribe list:

* reduces the likelihood of your emails being marked as spam
* improves deliverability for any other marketing or transactional emails you send

When you include an [an unsubscribe link in your Broadcasts](/dashboard/segments/introduction#automatic-unsubscribes), Resend will automatically handle the unsubscribe flow for you.

## Unsubscribe Statuses

The Contacts page shows the global unsubscribe status of each Contact.

* **Subscribed**: the Contact is subscribed to at least one Topic.

To filter by Status, click on the **All Statuses** filter next to the search bar, then select a value.

## Topic Subscription Statuses

You can view the subscription status of each Topic for a given Contact by clicking on the Contact's row.

Verify your domain on DreamHost with Resend.

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<img alt="Domain Details" />

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.
</Tip>

## Log in to DreamHost

1. Log in to your [DreamHost panel](https://panel.dreamhost.com).
2. Go to **Websites > Manage Websites**.
3. Select **Manage** on the domain you want to verify.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to DreamHost:


| DreamHost | Resend   | Example Value                           |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type      | Type     | `MX Record`                             |
| Host      | Name     | `send`                                  |
| Points to | Value    | `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` |

<Info>MX record will differ depending on your selected sending region.</Info>

<Info>
  Do not use the same priority for multiple MX records. If Priority `10` is
  already in use, try a higher value such as `20` or `30`.
</Info>

## Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

Add an MX record for receiving:

1. Click the **Add Record** button.
2. Hover over the **MX Record** section and click **ADD**.
3. Enter `inbound` (or your receiving subdomain) in the **Host** field.
4. Copy the MX Value from Resend into the **Points to** field.
5. Enter `10` for **Priority**.
6. Click **Add Record** to save.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to DreamHost:


| DreamHost | Resend   | Example Value                          |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Type      | Type     | `MX Record`                            |
| Host      | Name     | `inbound`                              |
| Points to | Content  | `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| Priority  | Priority | `10`                                   |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

## Complete Verification

Now click [Verify DNS Records](https://resend.com/domains) on your Domain in Resend. It may take up to 72 hours to complete the verification process (often much faster). DNS updates at DreamHost can take several hours to propagate.

## Troubleshooting

If your domain is not successfully verified, these are some common troubleshooting methods.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resend shows my domain verification failed.">
    Review the records you added to DreamHost to rule out copy and paste errors.
    Ensure the **Host** field uses only the subdomain (e.g., `send` or
    `resend._domainkey`) and that you did not include the full domain name.

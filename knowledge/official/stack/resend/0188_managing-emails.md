Each email contains a **Preview**, **Plain Text**, and **HTML** version to visualize the content of your sent email in its various formats.

## Understand email events

Here are all the events that can be associated with an email:

* `bounced` - The recipient's mail server rejected the email. ([Learn more about bounced emails](/dashboard/emails/email-bounces))
* `canceled` - The scheduled email was canceled (by user).
* `clicked` - The recipient clicked on a link in the email.
* `complained` - The email was successfully delivered to the recipient's mail server, but the recipient marked it as spam.
* `delivered` - Resend successfully delivered the email to the recipient's mail server.
* `delivery_delayed` - The email couldn't be delivered to the recipient's mail server because a temporary issue occurred. Delivery delays can occur, for example, when the recipient's inbox is full, or when the receiving email server experiences a transient issue.
* `failed` - The email failed to be sent.
* `opened` - The recipient opened the email. ([Open rates are not always accurate](/knowledge-base/why-are-my-open-rates-not-accurate))
* `queued` - The email created from Broadcasts or Batches is queued for delivery.
* `scheduled` - The email is scheduled for delivery.
* `sent` - The email was sent successfully.
* `suppressed` - The email was not sent because the recipient is on the suppression list. ([Learn more about the suppression list](/knowledge-base/why-are-my-emails-landing-on-the-suppression-list))

## Share email link

You can share a public link of a sent email, which is valid for 48 hours. Anyone with the link can visualize the email.

To share a link, click on the **dropdown menu** <Icon icon="ellipsis" />, and select **Share email**.

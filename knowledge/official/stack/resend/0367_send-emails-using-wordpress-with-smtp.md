Learn how to send your first email using Wordpress.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:

* [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
* [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

## 1. Install a plugin

First, you'll need to install and activate the [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) plugin. Once the plugin is activated you will see the setup wizard. You can skip this step as we'll guide you through how to configure the plugin for Resend. Just click on **Go to the Dashboard** at the bottom of the screen to exit the setup wizard.

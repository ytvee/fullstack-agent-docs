# AWS Route 53

Source: https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/route53

Verify your domain on Route 53 with Resend.

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.
</Tip>

## Log in to Route 53

Then, log in to your [AWS Management Console, and open Route 53 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/), then click on your domain name. From there, click on `Create Record`.

## Add MX SPF Record

1. Type in `send` for the `Record name`.
2. Select the `Record type` dropdown, and choose `MX`.
3. Copy the MX Value from your domain in Resend into the `Value` field.
4. Be sure to include the `10` in the `Value` field, as seen in the screenshot.

<Info>
  Omit your domain from the record values in Resend when you paste. Instead of
  `send.example.com`, paste only `send` (or `send.subdomain` if you're using a
  subdomain).

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Route 53:


| Route 53       | Resend           | Example Value                              |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Record Type    | Type             | `MX Record`                                |
| Record name    | Name             | `send`                                     |
| Value          | Value & Priority | `10 feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` |
| TTL            | TTL              | `Use Route 53 Default (300)`               |
| Routing policy | -                | `Simple routing`                           |

<Info>
  Route 53 does not label the `priority` column, and you will need to add this
  in to the `Value` section, as shown in the screenshot. Do not use the same
  priority for multiple records. If Priority `10` is already in use, try a
  number slightly higher like `11` or `12`.
</Info>

## Add TXT SPF Record

In the same section, choose `Add another record`:

1. Type in `send` for the `Record name`.
2. Click the `Record type` dropdown.
3. Select the `Record type` dropdown, and choose `TXT`.
4. Copy TXT Value from your domain in Resend into the `Value` field.

</Info>

## Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

In the Route 53 console, click `Create Record`:

1. Type in `inbound` (or whatever your subdomain is) for the `Record name`.
2. Select the `Record type` dropdown, and choose `MX`.
3. Copy the MX Value from your domain in Resend into the `Value` field.
4. Be sure to include the `10` in the `Value` field (e.g., `10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Route 53:


| Route 53       | Resend             | Example Value                             |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Record Type    | Type               | `MX Record`                               |
| Record name    | Name               | `inbound`                                 |
| Value          | Content & Priority | `10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| TTL            | TTL                | `Use Route 53 Default (300)`              |
| Routing policy | -                  | `Simple routing`                          |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

## Complete Verification

Now click [Verify DNS Records](https://resend.com/domains) on your Domain in Resend. It may take up to 5 hours to complete the verification process (often much faster).

## Troubleshooting

If your domain is not successfully verified, these are some common troubleshooting methods.

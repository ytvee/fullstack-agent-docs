Verify your domain on Porkbun with Resend.

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Porkbun:


| Porkbun        | Resend   | Example Value                           |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type           | Type     | `MX Record`                             |

<Info>
  Do not use the same priority for multiple records. If Priority `10` is already
  in use on another record, try a higher value `20` or `30`.

## Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

In the `DNS` section on Porkbun:

1. On the `Type` page, choose `MX`.
2. Type `inbound` (or whatever your subdomain is) for the `Host` of the record.
3. Copy the MX Value from Resend into the `Answer / Value` field.
4. Use the default TTL of `600`.
5. In the `Priority` field enter `10`.
6. Select `Add`.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Porkbun:


| Porkbun        | Resend   | Example Value                          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Type           | Type     | `MX Record`                            |
| Host           | Name     | `inbound`                              |
| Answer / Value | Content  | `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| TTL            | TTL      | `600`                                  |
| Priority       | Priority | `10`                                   |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

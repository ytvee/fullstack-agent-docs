Learn how to add the Resend integration to your Anything project.

[Anything](https://createanything.com) is a platform for building web sites, tools, apps, and projects via chat. With their [Resend integration](https://www.createanything.com/docs/integrations/resend), you can send emails from your Anything project.

## 1. Call the Resend integration in Anything

Type `/Resend` in the chat and select the integration, and ask Anything to add email functionality to your project.

## 2. Add your Resend API key

Anything usually prompts you for a Resend API key, which you can add in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys). If Anything doesn't prompt you for a Resend API key, click the **More options** <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> button and select **Secrets**.

Click the <Icon icon="plus" /> **Add new secret** button.

* **Name:** `RESEND_API_KEY`
* **Value:** Your Resend API key (e.g., `re_xxxxxxxxx0`)

## 3. Add a custom domain to your Resend account

By default, you can only send emails to your own email address.

To send emails to other email addresses:

1. Add a [custom domain to your Resend account](https://resend.com/domains).
2. Add the custom domain to the `from` field in the `resend` function in Create.

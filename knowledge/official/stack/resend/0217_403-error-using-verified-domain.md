# 403 Error Using Verified Domain

Source: https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/403-error-domain-mismatch

Learn how to resolve a 403 error caused by using a domain in your API request that doesn't match your verified domain.

A 403 error can occur when there's a mismatch between the domain you're using in your API request and the domain you've verified in Resend.

## The Problem

You've verified a domain (or subdomain) in Resend, but your API request is using a different domain.

**Example scenario:**

* You verified `sending.domain.com` in Resend
* Your API request is using `domain.com` (i.e., without the `sending` subdomain)

## How to Identify This Issue

1. Check which domain you've verified in your [Resend Domains page](https://resend.com/domains).
2. Compare it with the domain you're using in [your API request's](https://resend.com/logs) `from` field.

## Solution

You have two options to resolve this:

**Option 1: Update your API request** (Recommended)

Update your API call to use the verified domain. For example, if you verified `sending.domain.com`, make sure your `from` field uses that exact domain:

```javascript
resend.emails.send({
  from: 'onboarding@sending.domain.com', // Use your verified domain
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello World',
  html: '<p>Hello World</p>',
});
```
**Option 2: Delete and re-add the domain**

1. Delete the domain you've added in Resend
2. Add and verify the domain that matches what you're using in your API request

<Warning>
  Make sure the domain in your API request exactly matches the domain you've
  verified in Resend, including any subdomains.
</Warning>

## Still Having Issues?

If you've verified that your domain matches and you're still getting a 403 error:

1. Verify that your domain is fully verified in the [Resend Domains page](https://resend.com/domains).
2. Double-check that the domain in your API request's `from` field exactly matches your verified domain
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions.

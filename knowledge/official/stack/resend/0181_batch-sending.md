# Batch Sending

Source: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/emails/batch-sending

Send up to 100 emails in a single API call.

Batch sending allows you to send multiple emails at once (up to 100) instead of making individual API requests for each email.

## When to use batch sending

Use batch sending when you need to:

* Send multiple transactional emails (e.g., order confirmations, notifications, etc.)
* Trigger emails to different recipients with unique content
* Reduce the number of API calls to improve performance

<Note>
  For marketing campaigns, [use our no-code editor,
  Broadcasts](/dashboard/broadcasts/introduction), instead.
</Note>

## Send batch emails

You can send up to 100 emails in a single API call using the batch endpoint. Each email in the batch can have different recipients, subjects, and content.

## Response format

The batch endpoint returns an array of email IDs for successfully created emails.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "ae2014de-c168-4c61-8267-70d2662a1ce1"
    },
    {
      "id": "faccb7a5-8a28-4e9a-ac64-8da1cc3bc1cb"
    }
  ]
}
```
If the request fails, the response will include an `error` object with a `message` property. You can find more information about the error in the [Errors](/api-reference/errors) section of the API Reference.

## Limitations

When using batch sending, keep in mind:

* Maximum of **100 emails** per batch request
* The `attachments` field is not supported yet
* The `scheduled_at` field is not supported yet
* Each email in the batch is processed independently
* The request will fail and return an error if any email in your payload is invalid (e.g., required fields are missing, fields contain invalid data, etc.).

## View batch emails

All emails sent via the batch endpoint appear in the [Emails](https://resend.com/emails) page of your dashboard, just like individually sent emails. Each email will have a `queued` status initially before being processed.

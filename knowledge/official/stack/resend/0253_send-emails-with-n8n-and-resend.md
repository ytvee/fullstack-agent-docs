# Send emails with n8n and Resend

Source: https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/n8n-integration

Learn how to install and use the official Resend node for n8n to send emails, manage contacts, handle webhooks, and more.

[n8n](https://n8n.io) is a workflow automation platform that lets you connect apps and build powerful automations. The official [Resend node](https://github.com/resend/n8n-nodes-resend) (`n8n-nodes-resend`) provides full coverage of the Resend API — letting you send emails, manage contacts, handle domains, trigger workflows from email events, and much more, all from within n8n.

</Step>

<Step title="Setup Resend">
1. [Create an API Key](https://resend.com/api-keys): copy this key to your clipboard
2. [Verify your own domain](https://resend.com/domains): to send to email addresses other than your own
</Step>

<Step title="Add your Resend API credential">
1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** > **Add credential**.
2. Search for **Resend API** and paste your API key.

This credential is used by the main **Resend** node for all API operations.
</Step>

<Step title="Send your first email">
1. Click the **+** (Add node) connector on the canvas.
2. Search for **Resend** in the nodes panel.
3. n8n displays a list of available actions — select **Send an Email**.
4. The Resend node is added to your workflow with the **Send** operation pre-selected.
5. Fill in the **From**, **To**, **Subject**, and **Email Body** fields.
6. Execute the node.

<Note>
  By default, you can only send emails to your own email address using the
  `onboarding@resend.dev` sender domain. To send to other recipients, [add a
  custom domain](/dashboard/domains/introduction) to your Resend account.

## Human in the Loop (Send and Wait)

The **Send and Wait for Response** operation enables human-in-the-loop workflows. Send an email and pause the workflow until the recipient responds — via approval buttons or a free-text form.

1. Select the **Email** resource and the **Send and Wait for Response** operation.
2. Choose a **Response Type**: **Approval** (buttons) or **Free Text** (form).
3. Configure the email content and any wait-time limits.
4. The workflow pauses until the recipient clicks a button or submits the form.


| Option                   | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Response Type**        | Choose between Approval (buttons) or Free Text (form)    |
| **Approval Type**        | Single button (Approve only) or Double (Approve/Decline) |
| **Button Labels**        | Customize the button text                                |
| **Message Button Label** | Label for the form link button (Free Text mode)          |
| **Response Form Title**  | Title shown on the response form                         |
| **Limit Wait Time**      | Set a timeout for the wait period                        |

## Receive webhooks with the Resend Trigger

The **Resend Trigger** node lets you start workflows automatically when email events occur in Resend (e.g., an email is delivered, opened, or bounced). Webhook signatures are verified automatically using Svix.

### Set up the Trigger node

1. Add a **Resend Trigger** node to your workflow.
2. Create a **Resend Webhook Signing Secret** credential:
   * Create a webhook endpoint in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/webhooks).
   * Copy the signing secret (starts with `whsec_`).
   * In n8n, go to **Credentials** > **Add credential**, search for **Resend Webhook Signing Secret**, and paste the secret.

<Info>
  Give each webhook credential a unique name (e.g., "Resend Webhook — Bounces"
  or "Resend Webhook — Delivery Events"). This makes it much easier to identify
  the right credential when you have multiple triggers connected to different
  webhooks.
</Info>

3. Select the events you want to listen for.
4. Copy the **webhook URL** from the Trigger node and paste it into your Resend Dashboard webhook configuration.

### Supported trigger events

## Example workflow: Send a welcome email when a contact is created

Here's a simple workflow you can build with the Resend nodes:

1. **Resend Trigger** — listens for `contact.created` events.
2. **Resend** (Email > Send) — sends a welcome email to the new contact using data from the trigger.

The Trigger-Action pattern works for any event. For example, you could notify your team on Slack when an email bounces, or log delivery events to a spreadsheet.

<Note>
  The Resend node is also available as an [AI
  tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/)
  in n8n, so you can use it inside AI agent workflows.

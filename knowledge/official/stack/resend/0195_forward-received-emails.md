# Forward Received Emails

Source: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/receiving/forward-emails

Forward Received emails to another email address.

Received emails can also be forwarded to another email address.

<Info>
  Webhooks do not include the email body, headers, or attachments, only their
  metadata. You must call the [Received emails
  API](/api-reference/emails/retrieve-received-email) or the [Attachments
  API](/api-reference/emails/list-received-email-attachments) to retrieve them.
  This design choice supports large attachments in serverless environments that
  have limited request body sizes.

## Using the `forward` helper method

The Node.js SDK provides a `forward()` helper method that simplifies forwarding received emails. This method automatically handles fetching the email content and attachments.

Here's how you can implement this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts Next.js theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
  import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
  import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => {
const event = await request.json();

if (event.type === 'email.received') {
  const { data, error } = await resend.emails.receiving.forward({
    emailId: event.data.email_id,
    to: 'delivered@resend.dev',
    from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
  });

  if (error) {
    return new NextResponse(`Error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
  }

  return NextResponse.json(data);
}

return NextResponse.json({});
};

```

```rust Rust theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
async fn example(
    State(state): State<Arc<AppState>>,
    Json(event): Json<resend_rs::events::EmailEvent>,
) -> Result<Response, Response> {
    if matches!(
        event.r#type,
        resend_rs::events::EmailEventType::EmailReceived
    ) {
        let opts = ForwardReceivingEmail::new(
            InboundEmailId::new(&event.data.email_id),
            "onboarding@resend.dev",
            vec!["delivered@resend.dev"],
        );
        let data = state.resend.receiving.forward(opts).await.map_err(|e| {
            (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, format!("Error: {}", e)).into_response()
        })?;
        Ok(Json(data).into_response())
    } else {
        Ok(Json(Empty {}).into_response())
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

By default, the `forward` method forwards the email in a way that preserves the original email content and attachments exactly as received.

Alternatively, you can forward emails as if they had been forwarded through an email client, with the `forwarded message` footer. For that, use `passthrough: false` and provide custom text or HTML content. The original email will be shown after the `forwarded message` footer:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts Next.js theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
  const { data, error } = await resend.emails.receiving.forward({
    emailId: event.data.email_id,
    to: 'delivered@resend.dev',
    from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
    passthrough: false,
    text: 'See attached forwarded message.',
    html: '<p>See attached forwarded message.</p>',
  });
  ```

```rust
let opts = ForwardReceivingEmail::new(
    InboundEmailId::new(&event.data.email_id),
    "onboarding@resend.dev",
    vec!["delivered@resend.dev"],
)
.with_passthrough(false)
.with_text("See attached forwarded message.")
.with_html("<p>See attached forwarded message.</p>");

let data = state.resend.receiving.forward(opts).await;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Manual forwarding

If you're not using Node.js or prefer not to use the `forward` helper method, you can manually forward received emails using the [Send Email API](/api-reference/emails/send-email).

The recommended approach is to download the raw email and parse it to properly extract content and attachments (especially for inline images). Then, you can send a new email with the extracted content and attachments using the [Send Email API](/api-reference/emails/send-email).

<CodeGroup>
  ```js app/api/events/route.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
  import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
  import { Resend } from 'resend';
  import { simpleParser } from 'mailparser';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => {
const event = await request.json();

if (event.type === 'email.received') {
  // Get the email metadata
  const { data: email } = await resend
    .emails
    .receiving
    .get(event.data.email_id);

  // Download the raw email content if available
  if (!email?.raw?.download_url) {
    return new NextResponse('Raw email not available', { status: 500 });
  }

  const rawResponse = await fetch(email.raw.download_url);
  const rawEmailContent = await rawResponse.text();

  // Parse the raw email to extract content and attachments
  const parsed = await simpleParser(rawEmailContent, {
    skipImageLinks: true,
  });

  // Extract attachments with content_id for inline images
  const attachments = parsed.attachments.map((attachment) => {
    // Strip < and > from content IDs for proper inline image handling
    const contentId = attachment.contentId
      ? attachment.contentId.replace(/^<|>$/g, '')
      : undefined;

    return {
      filename: attachment.filename,
      content: attachment.content.toString('base64'),
      content_type: attachment.contentType,
      content_id: contentId || undefined,
    };
  });

  const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>',
    to: ['delivered@resend.dev'],
    subject: email.subject || '(no subject)',
    html: parsed.html || undefined,
    text: parsed.text || undefined,
    attachments: attachments.length > 0 ? attachments : undefined,
  });

  if (error) {
    return new NextResponse(`Error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
  }

  return NextResponse.json(data);
}

return NextResponse.json({});
};

```

<Note>
This example uses the [`mailparser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailparser)
library (`npm install mailparser`) to parse the raw email. For other
languages/SDKs, you'll need an equivalent email parsing library capable of
processing emails compliant to [RFC
5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322).

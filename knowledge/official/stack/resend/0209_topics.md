# Topics

Source: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/topics/introduction

Give your users more control over their subscription preferences.

Managing subscribers and unsubscribers is a critical part of any email implementation. Topics are used by your contacts to manage their email preferences.

When you send [Broadcasts](/dashboard/broadcasts/introduction), you can optionally scope sending to a particular Topic. Not only does scoping your sending help you send more precisely, but it also allows your users to manage their preferences with more control.

  them](/knowledge-base/why-use-topics), including how they improve
  deliverability and differ from Segments.

## Add a Topic

You can create a new Topic from the [dashboard](https://resend.com/audience/topics) or [via the API](/api-reference/topics/create-topic).

1. Click **Create Topic**.
2. Give your Topic a name.
3. Give your Topic a description (optional).
4. Select **Opt-in** or **Opt-out** as the default subscription. This value **cannot** be changed later.
   * **Opt-in**: all Contacts will receive the email unless they have explicitly unsubscribed from that Topic.
   * **Opt-out**: subscribers will not receive the email unless they have explicitly subscribed to that Topic.
5. Select **Public** or **Private** as the visibility.
   * **Private**: only Contacts who are opted in to the Topic can see it on the unsubscribe page.
   * **Public**: all Contacts can see the Topic on the unsubscribe page.

You can also [delete a Topic](/api-reference/topics/delete-topic) via the API.

## Editing Topics for a Contact

As you receive [proper consent to email Contacts](/knowledge-base/what-counts-as-email-consent), add the Contact to a given Topic. A Contact can belong to multiple Topics.

You can add a Contact to a Topic via the dashboard by expanding the **More options** <Icon icon="ellipsis" /> and then **Edit Contact**. Add or remove Topics for a given Contact.

<Note>
  The **Subscribed** status is a global setting that enables or disables sending to a Contact for Broadcasts.

* If a Contact's **Subscribed** status is
  **false**, they will not receive emails from your account, even if they have
  opted-in to a specific Topic.
* If the **Subscribed** status is **true**, they
  can receive emails from your account.

## Sending Broadcast with a Topic

You can send with a Topic in the Broadcast editor from the Topics dropdown menu.

You can also send with a Topic via the [Broadcast API](/api-reference/broadcasts/create-broadcast).

## Unsubscribing from a Topic

If a Contact clicks a Broadcast unsubscribe link, they will see a preference page where they can:

* Unsubscribe from certain **Topics** (types of email)
* Or unsubscribe from **everything** you send

If they unsubscribe from a Topic or several Topics, they will no longer receive emails for those Topics. If they unsubscribe from all emails from your account, Broadcasts will no longer send to them.

You can [customize your unsubscribe page with your branding](/dashboard/settings/unsubscribe-page) from your team settings.

# Managing Segments

Source: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/segments/introduction

Learn how to create, retrieve, and delete segments.

Segments are used to group and manage your [Contacts](/dashboard/audiences/contacts). Segments are not visible to your Contacts, but are used for your own internal Contact organization.

## Send emails to your Segment

Segments were designed to be used in conjunction with [Broadcasts](/dashboard/broadcasts/introduction). You can send a Broadcast to an Segment from the Resend dashboard or from the Broadcast API.

### From Resend's no-code editor

You can send emails to your Segment by creating a new Broadcast and selecting the Segment you want to send it to.

<img alt="Send emails to your Segment" />

You can include the Unsubscribe Footer in your Broadcasts, which will be automatically replaced with the correct link for each Contact.

### From the Broadcast API

You can also use our [Broadcast API](/api-reference/broadcasts/create-broadcast) to create and send a Broadcast to your Segment.

## How to customize the unsubscribe link in my Broadcast?

Resend generates a unique link for each recipient and each Broadcast. You can use `{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}` as the link target.

<img alt="Unsubscribe Link" />

## Automatic Unsubscribes

When you send emails to your Segment, Resend will automatically handle the unsubscribe flow for you.

<img alt="Automatic Unsubscribes" />

If a Contact unsubscribes from your emails, they will be presented with a preference page.

* If you don't have any [Topics](/dashboard/topics/introduction) configured, the Contact will be unsubscribed from all emails from your account.
* If you have [Topics](/dashboard/topics/introduction) configured, the Contact will be presented with a preference page where they can subscribe or unsubscribe from specific types of emails (all `public` Topics will be shown).

Learn more about [managing your unsubscribe list](/dashboard/audiences/managing-unsubscribe-list) or [customizing your unsubscribe page](/dashboard/settings/unsubscribe-page).

<Info>
  Whenever possible, you should add a [Topic to your
  Broadcast](/dashboard/topics/introduction), as this will allow your Contacts
  to unsubscribe from specific types of emails (instead of unsubscribing from
  all emails from your account). Learn more about [why and when to use
  Topics](/knowledge-base/why-use-topics).

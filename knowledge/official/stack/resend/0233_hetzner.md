# Hetzner

Source: https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/hetzner

Verify your domain on Hetzner with Resend.

## Add Domain to Resend

First, log in to your [Resend Account](https://resend.com/login) and [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains).

<img alt="Domain Details" />

<Tip>
  It is [best practice to use a
  subdomain](/knowledge-base/is-it-better-to-send-emails-from-a-subdomain-or-the-root-domain)
  (updates.example.com) instead of the root domain (example.com). Using a
  subdomain allows for proper reputation segmentation based on topics or purpose
  (e.g. marketing) and is especially important if receiving emails with Resend.
</Tip>

## Log in to Hetzner

Log in to your [Hetzner account](https://dns.hetzner.com):

1. Choose your Domain from the `Your Zones` list.
2. Select the `Records` tab to get to the page to manage DNS records.

## Add MX SPF Record

In the `Create Record` section on Hetzner copy and paste the values MX from Resend:

1. On the `Type` page, choose `MX`.
2. Type `send` for the `Name` of the record.
3. Select the `Value` field.
4. Use the default `Priority` of `10`.
5. Copy the MX Value from Resend into the `Mail server` field.
6. Select the TTL of `1800`.
7. Select `Add Record`.

<Info>
  Hetzner requires your MX record to have a trailing period when adding. Resend
  will include the trailing period when copying. Removing the period will cause
  the verification to fail.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Hetzner:


| Hetzner     | Resend   | Example Value                            |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Type        | Type     | `MX Record`                              |
| Name        | Name     | `send`                                   |
| Mail server | Value    | `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com.` |
| TTL         | TTL      | `1800`                                   |
| Priority    | Priority | `10`                                     |

<Info>
  Do not use the same priority for multiple records. If Priority `10` is already
  in use on another record, try a higher value `20` or `30`.
</Info>

## Add TXT SPF Record

On the same `Create Record` section:

1. On the `Type` page, choose `TXT`.
2. Type `send` for the `Name` of the record.
3. Copy the TXT Value Resend into the `Value` field.
4. Select the TTL of `1800`.
5. Select `Add Record`.

<Info>
  Omit your domain from the record values in Resend when you paste. Instead of
  `send.example.com`, paste only `send` (or `send.subdomain` if you're using a
  subdomain).

## Receiving Emails

If you want to receive emails at your domain, toggle the "Receiving" switch on the domain details page.

<img alt="Enable Receiving Emails for a verified domain" />

<Warning>
  When you enable Inbound on a domain, Resend receives *all emails* sent to that
  specific domain depending on the priority of the MX record. For this reason,
  we strongly recommend verifying a subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) instead
  of the root domain (`example.com`). Learn more about [avoiding conflicts with
  your existing MX
  records](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-avoid-conflicting-with-my-mx-records).
</Warning>

In the `Create Record` section on Hetzner:

1. On the `Type` page, choose `MX`.
2. Type `inbound` (or whatever your subdomain is) for the `Name` of the record.
3. Select the `Value` field.
4. Use the default `Priority` of `10`.
5. Copy the MX Value from Resend into the `Mail server` field.
6. Select the TTL of `1800`.
7. Select `Add Record`.

Below is a mapping of the record fields from Resend to Hetzner:


| Hetzner     | Resend   | Example Value                           |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type        | Type     | `MX Record`                             |
| Name        | Name     | `inbound`                               |
| Mail server | Content  | `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.` |
| TTL         | TTL      | `1800`                                  |
| Priority    | Priority | `10`                                    |

After verifying your domain, create a webhook to process incoming emails. For help setting up a webhook, how to access email data and attachments, forward emails, and more, see [our guide on receiving emails with Resend](/dashboard/receiving/introduction).

## Complete Verification

Now click [Verify DNS Records](https://resend.com/domains) on your Domain in Resend. It may take a few hours to complete the verification process (often much faster).

## Troubleshooting

If your domain is not successfully verified, these are some common troubleshooting methods.

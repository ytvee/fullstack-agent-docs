# Send emails with Leap and Resend

Source: https://resend.com/docs/leap-new-integration

Learn how to add the Resend integration to your Leap.new project.

[Leap](https://leap.new) is a platform for building full-stack web and mobile apps via chat.

## 1. Ask Leap to add Resend

You can add Resend in a Leap project by asking the chat to add email sending with Resend.

**Example prompt**

```
When someone fills out the contact form, send an email using Resend.
```
## 2. Add your Resend API key

To use Resend with Leap, you'll need to add a Resend API key, which you can create in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys). Do not share your API key with others or expose it in the browser or other client-side code.

Leap will prompt you to set a secret value on the Infrastructure page. Paste your key value and click **Update secret**.

## 3. Add a custom domain to your Resend account

By default, you can only send emails to your own email address.

To send emails to other email addresses:

1. Add a [custom domain to your Resend account](https://resend.com/domains).
2. Add the custom domain to the `from` field in the `resend` function in Leap (or ask the chat to update these fields).

Get more help adding a custom domain in [Resend's documentation](/dashboard/domains/introduction).

# Process Receiving Attachments

Source: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/receiving/attachments

Process attachments from receiving emails.

A common use case for Receiving emails is to process attachments.

<Info>
  Webhooks do not include the actual content of attachments, only their
  metadata. You must call the [Attachments
  API](/api-reference/emails/list-received-email-attachments) to retrieve the
  content. This design choice supports large attachments in serverless
  environments that have limited request body sizes.
</Info>

Users can forward airplane tickets, receipts, and expenses to you. Then, you can extract key information from attachments and use that data.

To do this, call the [Attachments API](/api-reference/emails/list-received-email-attachments) after receiving the webhook event. That API will return a list of attachments with their metadata and a `download_url` that you can use to download the actual content.

Note that the `download_url` is valid for 1 hour. After that, you will need to call the
[Attachments API](/api-reference/emails/list-received-email-attachments)
again to get a new `download_url`. You can also check the `expires_at` field on
each attachment to see exactly when it will expire.

Here's how you can implement this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts Next.js theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
  // app/api/events/route.ts
  import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
  import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => {
const event = await request.json();

if (event.type === 'email.received') {
  const { data: attachments } =
    await resend.emails.receiving.attachments.list({
      emailId: event.data.email_id,
    });

  for (const attachment of attachments) {
    // use the download_url to download attachments however you want
    const response = await fetch(attachment.download_url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      console.error(`Failed to download ${attachment.filename}`);
      continue;
    }

    // get the file's contents
    const buffer = Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer());

    // process the content (e.g., save to storage, analyze, etc.)
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ attachmentsProcessed: attachments.length });
}

return NextResponse.json({});
};

```

Once you process attachments, you may want to forward the email to another address. Learn more about [forwarding emails](/dashboard/receiving/forward-emails).

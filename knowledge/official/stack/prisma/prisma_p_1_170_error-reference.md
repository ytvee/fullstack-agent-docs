# Error Reference (/docs/orm/reference/error-reference)



For more information about how to work with exceptions and error codes, see [Handling exceptions and errors](/orm/prisma-client/debugging-and-troubleshooting/handling-exceptions-and-errors).

Prisma Client error types [#prisma-client-error-types]

Prisma Client throws different kinds of errors. The following lists the exception types, and their documented data fields:

PrismaClientKnownRequestError [#prismaclientknownrequesterror]

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` exception if the query engine returns a known error related to the request - for example, a unique constraint violation.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`          | A Prisma-specific [error code](#error-codes).                                                                    |
| `meta`          | Additional information about the error - for example, the field that caused the error: `{ target: [ 'email' ] }` |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes).                                                        |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)                                                                 |

PrismaClientUnknownRequestError [#prismaclientunknownrequesterror]

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError` exception if the query engine returns an error related to a request that does not have an error code.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes). |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)          |

PrismaClientRustPanicError [#prismaclientrustpanicerror]

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientRustPanicError` exception if the underlying engine crashes and exits with a non-zero exit code. In this case, Prisma Client or the whole Node process must be restarted.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes). |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)          |

PrismaClientInitializationError [#prismaclientinitializationerror]

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientInitializationError` exception if something goes wrong when the query engine is started and the connection to the database is created. This happens either:

* When `prisma.$connect()` is called OR
* When the first query is executed

Errors that can occur include:

* The provided credentials for the database are invalid
* There is no database server running under the provided hostname and port
* The port that the query engine HTTP server wants to bind to is already taken
* A missing or inaccessible environment variable
* The query engine binary for the current platform could not be found (`generator` block)

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `errorCode`     | A Prisma-specific error code.                             |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes). |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)          |

PrismaClientValidationError [#prismaclientvalidationerror]

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientValidationError` exception if validation fails - for example:

* Missing field - for example, an empty `data: {}` property when creating a new record
* Incorrect field type provided (for example, setting a `Boolean` field to `"Hello, I like cheese and gold!"`)

| **Property**    | **Description**                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `message`       | Error message.                                   |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`) |

Prisma Accelerate [#prisma-accelerate]

Prisma Accelerate-related errors start with `P6xxx` except for [`P5011`](/orm/reference/error-reference#p5011-too-many-requests).

P6000 (ServerError) [#p6000-servererror]

Generic error to catch all other errors.

P6001 (InvalidDataSource) [#p6001-invaliddatasource]

The URL is malformed; for instance, it does not use the `prisma://` protocol.

P6002 (Unauthorized) [#p6002-unauthorized]

The API Key in the connection string is invalid.

P6003 (PlanLimitReached) [#p6003-planlimitreached]

The included usage of the current plan has been exceeded. This can only occur on the [free plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing).

P6004 (QueryTimeout) [#p6004-querytimeout]

The global timeout of Accelerate has been exceeded.

> Also see the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/more/troubleshoot#p6004-querytimeout) for more information.

P6005 (InvalidParameters) [#p6005-invalidparameters]

The user supplied invalid parameters. Currently only relevant for transaction methods. For example, setting a timeout that is too high.

P6006 (VersionNotSupported) [#p6006-versionnotsupported]

The chosen Prisma version is not compatible with Accelerate. This may occur when a user uses an unstable development version that we occasionally prune.

P6008 (ConnectionError|EngineStartError) [#p6008-connectionerrorenginestarterror]

The engine failed to start. For example, it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

> Also see the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/more/troubleshoot#p6008-connectionerrorenginestarterror) for more information.

P6009 (ResponseSizeLimitExceeded) [#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded]

The global response size limit of Accelerate has been exceeded.

> Also see the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/more/troubleshoot#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded) for more information.

P6010 (ProjectDisabledError) [#p6010-projectdisablederror]

Your accelerate project is disabled. Please [enable](/accelerate/getting-started#1-enable-accelerate) it again to use it.

P5011 (Too Many Requests) [#p5011-too-many-requests]

This error indicates that the request volume exceeded. Implement a back-off strategy and try again later. For assistance with expected high workloads, contact [support](/console/more/support).

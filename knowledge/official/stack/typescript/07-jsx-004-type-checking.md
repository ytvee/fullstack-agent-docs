## Type Checking

In order to understand type checking with JSX, you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements and value-based elements.
Given a JSX expression `<expr />`, `expr` may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a `div` or `span` in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you've created.
This is important for two reasons:

1. For React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (`React.createElement("div")`), whereas a component you've created is not (`React.createElement(MyComponent)`).
2. The types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently.
   Intrinsic element attributes should be known _intrinsically_ whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.

TypeScript uses the [same convention that React does](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#html-tags-vs.-react-components) for distinguishing between these.
An intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.

### `resolve`'s Parameters Are No Longer Optional in `Promise`s

When writing code like the following

```ts
new Promise((resolve) => {
  doSomethingAsync(() => {
    doSomething();
    resolve();
  });
});
```

You may get an error like the following:

```
  resolve()
  ~~~~~~~~~
error TS2554: Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.
  An argument for 'value' was not provided.
```

This is because `resolve` no longer has an optional parameter, so by default, it must now be passed a value.
Often this catches legitimate bugs with using `Promise`s.
The typical fix is to pass it the correct argument, and sometimes to add an explicit type argument.

```ts
new Promise<number>((resolve) => {
  //     ^^^^^^^^
  doSomethingAsync((value) => {
    doSomething();
    resolve(value);
    //      ^^^^^
  });
});
```

However, sometimes `resolve()` really does need to be called without an argument.
In these cases, we can give `Promise` an explicit `void` generic type argument (i.e. write it out as `Promise<void>`).
This leverages new functionality in TypeScript 4.1 where a potentially-`void` trailing parameter can become optional.

```ts
new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
  //     ^^^^^^
  doSomethingAsync(() => {
    doSomething();
    resolve();
  });
});
```

TypeScript 4.1 ships with a quick fix to help fix this break.

## Top-Level `await`

TypeScript 3.8 provides support for a handy upcoming ECMAScript feature called "top-level `await`".

JavaScript users often introduce an `async` function in order to use `await`, and then immediately called the function after defining it.

```js
async function main() {
  const response = await fetch("...");
  const greeting = await response.text();
  console.log(greeting);
}

main().catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

This is because previously in JavaScript (along with most other languages with a similar feature), `await` was only allowed within the body of an `async` function.
However, with top-level `await`, we can use `await` at the top level of a module.

```ts
const response = await fetch("...");
const greeting = await response.text();
console.log(greeting);

// Make sure we're a module
export {};
```

Note there's a subtlety: top-level `await` only works at the top level of a _module_, and files are only considered modules when TypeScript finds an `import` or an `export`.
In some basic cases, you might need to write out `export {}` as some boilerplate to make sure of this.

Top level `await` may not work in all environments where you might expect at this point.
Currently, you can only use top level `await` when the [`target`](/tsconfig#target) compiler option is `es2017` or above, and `module` is `esnext` or `system`.
Support within several environments and bundlers may be limited or may require enabling experimental support.

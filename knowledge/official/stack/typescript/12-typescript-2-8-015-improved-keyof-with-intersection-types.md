## Improved `keyof` with intersection types

With TypeScript 2.8 `keyof` applied to an intersection type is transformed to a union of `keyof` applied to each intersection constituent.
In other words, types of the form `keyof (A & B)` are transformed to be `keyof A | keyof B`.
This change should address inconsistencies with inference from `keyof` expressions.

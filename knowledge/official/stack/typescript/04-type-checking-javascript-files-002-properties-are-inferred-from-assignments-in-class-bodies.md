## Properties are inferred from assignments in class bodies

ES2015 does not have a means for declaring properties on classes. Properties are dynamically assigned, just like object literals.

In a `.js` file, the compiler infers properties from property assignments inside the class body.
The type of a property is the type given in the constructor, unless it's not defined there, or the type in the constructor is undefined or null.
In that case, the type is the union of the types of all the right-hand values in these assignments.
Properties defined in the constructor are always assumed to exist, whereas ones defined just in methods, getters, or setters are considered optional.

```js twoslash
// @checkJs
// @errors: 2322
class C {
  constructor() {
    this.constructorOnly = 0;
    this.constructorUnknown = undefined;
  }
  method() {
    this.constructorOnly = false;
    this.constructorUnknown = "plunkbat"; // ok, constructorUnknown is string | undefined
    this.methodOnly = "ok"; // ok, but methodOnly could also be undefined
  }
  method2() {
    this.methodOnly = true; // also, ok, methodOnly's type is string | boolean | undefined
  }
}
```

If properties are never set in the class body, they are considered unknown.
If your class has properties that are only read from, add and then annotate a declaration in the constructor with JSDoc to specify the type.
You don't even have to give a value if it will be initialized later:

```js twoslash
// @checkJs
// @errors: 2322
class C {
  constructor() {
    /** @type {number | undefined} */
    this.prop = undefined;
    /** @type {number | undefined} */
    this.count;
  }
}

let c = new C();
c.prop = 0; // OK
c.count = "string";
```

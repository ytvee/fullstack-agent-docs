### Partial Semantic Mode at Startup

We've heard a lot from users suffering from long startup times, especially on bigger projects.
The culprit is usually a process called _program construction_.
This is the process of starting with an initial set of root files, parsing them, finding their dependencies, parsing those dependencies, finding those dependencies' dependencies, and so on.
The bigger your project is, the longer you'll have to wait before you can get basic editor operations like go-to-definition or quick info.

That's why we've been working on a new mode for editors to provide a _partial_ experience until the full language service experience has loaded up.
The core idea is that editors can run a lightweight partial server that only looks at the current files that the editor has open.

It's hard to say precisely what sorts of improvements you'll see, but anecdotally, it used to take anywhere between _20 seconds to a minute_ before TypeScript would become fully responsive on the Visual Studio Code codebase.
In contrast, **our new partial semantic mode seems to bring that delay down to just a few seconds**.
As an example, in the following video, you can see two side-by-side editors with TypeScript 3.9 running on the left and TypeScript 4.0 running on the right.

</video>

When restarting both editors on a particularly large codebase, the one with TypeScript 3.9 can't provide completions or quick info at all.
On the other hand, the editor with TypeScript 4.0 can _immediately_ give us a rich experience in the current file we're editing, despite loading the full project in the background.

Currently the only editor that supports this mode is [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) which has some UX improvements coming up in [Visual Studio Code Insiders](http://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).
We recognize that this experience may still have room for polish in UX and functionality, and we have [a list of improvements](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/39035) in mind.
We're looking for more feedback on what you think might be useful.

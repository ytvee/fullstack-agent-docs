## Custom JSX Factories

When using JSX, a [_fragment_](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) is a type of JSX element that allows us to return multiple child elements.
When we first implemented fragments in TypeScript, we didn't have a great idea about how other libraries would utilize them.
Nowadays most other libraries that encourage using JSX and support fragments have a similar API shape.

In TypeScript 4.0, users can customize the fragment factory through the new [`jsxFragmentFactory`](/tsconfig#jsxFragmentFactory) option.

As an example, the following `tsconfig.json` file tells TypeScript to transform JSX in a way compatible with React, but switches each factory invocation to `h` instead of `React.createElement`, and uses `Fragment` instead of `React.Fragment`.

```jsonc tsconfig
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "jsx": "react",
    "jsxFactory": "h",
    "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
  }
}
```

In cases where you need to have a different JSX factory on a per-file basis<!-- (maybe you like to ship React, Preact, and Inferno to give a blazing fast experience) -->, you can take advantage of the new `/** @jsxFrag */` pragma comment.
For example, the following...

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
// Note: these pragma comments need to be written
// with a JSDoc-style multiline syntax to take effect.

/** @jsx h */
/** @jsxFrag Fragment */

import { h, Fragment } from "preact";

export const Header = (
  <>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
  </>
);
```

...will get transformed to this output JavaScript...

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
// @showEmit
// Note: these pragma comments need to be written
// with a JSDoc-style multiline syntax to take effect.

/** @jsx h */
/** @jsxFrag Fragment */

import { h, Fragment } from "preact";

export const Header = (
  <>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
  </>
);
```

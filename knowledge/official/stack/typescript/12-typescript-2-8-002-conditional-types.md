## Conditional Types

TypeScript 2.8 introduces _conditional types_ which add the ability to express non-uniform type mappings.
A conditional type selects one of two possible types based on a condition expressed as a type relationship test:

```ts
T extends U ? X : Y
```

The type above means when `T` is assignable to `U` the type is `X`, otherwise the type is `Y`.

A conditional type `T extends U ? X : Y` is either _resolved_ to `X` or `Y`, or _deferred_ because the condition depends on one or more type variables.
Whether to resolve or defer is determined as follows:

- First, given types `T'` and `U'` that are instantiations of `T` and `U` where all occurrences of type parameters are replaced with `any`, if `T'` is not assignable to `U'`, the conditional type is resolved to `Y`. Intuitively, if the most permissive instantiation of `T` is not assignable to the most permissive instantiation of `U`, we know that no instantiation will be and we can just resolve to `Y`.
- Next, for each type variable introduced by an `infer` (more later) declaration within `U` collect a set of candidate types by inferring from `T` to `U` (using the same inference algorithm as type inference for generic functions). For a given `infer` type variable `V`, if any candidates were inferred from co-variant positions, the type inferred for `V` is a union of those candidates. Otherwise, if any candidates were inferred from contra-variant positions, the type inferred for `V` is an intersection of those candidates. Otherwise, the type inferred for `V` is `never`.
- Then, given a type `T''` that is an instantiation of `T` where all `infer` type variables are replaced with the types inferred in the previous step, if `T''` is _definitely assignable_ to `U`, the conditional type is resolved to `X`. The definitely assignable relation is the same as the regular assignable relation, except that type variable constraints are not considered. Intuitively, when a type is definitely assignable to another type, we know that it will be assignable for _all instantiations_ of those types.
- Otherwise, the condition depends on one or more type variables and the conditional type is deferred.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Our `lib.d.ts` declarations have changed - most specifically, types for the DOM have changed.
The most notable change may be the removal of [`document.origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/origin) which only worked in old versions of IE and Safari
MDN recommends moving to [`self.origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/origin).

## Support for `defaultProps` in JSX

TypeScript 2.9 and earlier didn’t leverage [React `defaultProps`](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html#default-prop-values) declarations inside JSX components.
Users would often have to declare properties optional and use non-null assertions inside of `render`, or they'd use type-assertions to fix up the type of the component before exporting it.

TypeScript 3.0 adds support for a new type alias in the `JSX` namespace called `LibraryManagedAttributes`.
This helper type defines a transformation on the component's `Props` type, before using to check a JSX expression targeting it; thus allowing customization like: how conflicts between provided props and inferred props are handled, how inferences are mapped, how optionality is handled, and how inferences from differing places should be combined.

In short using this general type, we can model React's specific behavior for things like `defaultProps` and, to some extent, `propTypes`.

```tsx
export interface Props {
  name: string;
}

export class Greet extends React.Component<Props> {
  render() {
    const { name } = this.props;
    return <div>Hello {name.toUpperCase()}!</div>;
  }
  static defaultProps = { name: "world" };
}

// Type-checks! No type assertions needed!
let el = <Greet />;
```

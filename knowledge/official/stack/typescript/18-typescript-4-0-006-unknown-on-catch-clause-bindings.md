## `unknown` on `catch` Clause Bindings

Since the beginning days of TypeScript, `catch` clause variables have always been typed as `any`.
This meant that TypeScript allowed you to do anything you wanted with them.

```ts twoslash
// @useUnknownInCatchVariables: false
try {
  // Do some work
} catch (x) {
  // x has type 'any' - have fun!
  console.log(x.message);
  console.log(x.toUpperCase());
  x++;
  x.yadda.yadda.yadda();
}
```

The above has some undesirable behavior if we're trying to prevent _more_ errors from happening in our error-handling code!
Because these variables have the type `any` by default, they lack any type-safety which could have errored on invalid operations.

That's why TypeScript 4.0 now lets you specify the type of `catch` clause variables as `unknown` instead.
`unknown` is safer than `any` because it reminds us that we need to perform some sorts of type-checks before operating on our values.

<!--prettier-ignore -->
```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2571 18046
try {
  // ...
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // Can't access values on unknowns
  console.log(e.toUpperCase());

  if (typeof e === "string") {
    // We've narrowed 'e' down to the type 'string'.
    console.log(e.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```

While the types of `catch` variables won't change by default, we might consider a new [`strict`](/tsconfig#strict) mode flag in the future so that users can opt in to this behavior.
In the meantime, it should be possible to write a lint rule to force `catch` variables to have an explicit annotation of either `: any` or `: unknown`.

## Distributive conditional types

Conditional types in which the checked type is a naked type parameter are called _distributive conditional types_.
Distributive conditional types are automatically distributed over union types during instantiation.
For example, an instantiation of `T extends U ? X : Y` with the type argument `A | B | C` for `T` is resolved as `(A extends U ? X : Y) | (B extends U ? X : Y) | (C extends U ? X : Y)`.

## Mapped types on tuples and arrays

In TypeScript 3.1, mapped object types<sup>[[1]](#ts-3-1-only-homomorphic)</sup> over tuples and arrays now produce new tuples/arrays, rather than creating a new type where members like `push()`, `pop()`, and `length` are converted.
For example:

```ts
type MapToPromise<T> = { [K in keyof T]: Promise<T[K]> };

type Coordinate = [number, number];

type PromiseCoordinate = MapToPromise<Coordinate>; // [Promise<number>, Promise<number>]
```

`MapToPromise` takes a type `T`, and when that type is a tuple like `Coordinate`, only the numeric properties are converted.
In `[number, number]`, there are two numerically named properties: `0` and `1`.
When given a tuple like that, `MapToPromise` will create a new tuple where the `0` and `1` properties are `Promise`s of the original type.
So the resulting type `PromiseCoordinate` ends up with the type `[Promise<number>, Promise<number>]`.

#### No Implicit `any`

There are certain cases where TypeScript can't figure out what certain types should be.
To be as lenient as possible, it will decide to use the type `any` in its place.
While this is great for migration, using `any` means that you're not getting any type safety, and you won't get the same tooling support you'd get elsewhere.
You can tell TypeScript to flag these locations down and give an error with the [`noImplicitAny`](/tsconfig#noImplicitAny) option.

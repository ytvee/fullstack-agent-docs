## `export * as ns` Syntax

It's often common to have a single entry-point that exposes all the members of another module as a single member.

```ts
import * as utilities from "./utilities.js";
export { utilities };
```

This is so common that ECMAScript 2020 recently added a new syntax to support this pattern!

```ts
export * as utilities from "./utilities.js";
```

This is a nice quality-of-life improvement to JavaScript, and TypeScript 3.8 implements this syntax.
When your module target is earlier than `es2020`, TypeScript will output something along the lines of the first code snippet.

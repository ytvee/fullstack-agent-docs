### Rest elements in tuple types

The last element of a tuple type can be a rest element of the form `...X`, where `X` is an array type.
A rest element indicates that the tuple type is open-ended and may have zero or more additional elements of the array element type.
For example, `[number, ...string[]]` means tuples with a `number` element followed by any number of `string` elements.

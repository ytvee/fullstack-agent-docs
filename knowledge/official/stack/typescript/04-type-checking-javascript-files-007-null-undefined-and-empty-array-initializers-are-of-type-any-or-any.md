## null, undefined, and empty array initializers are of type any or any[]

Any variable, parameter or property that is initialized with null or undefined will have type any, even if strict null checks is turned on.
Any variable, parameter or property that is initialized with [] will have type any[], even if strict null checks is turned on.
The only exception is for properties that have multiple initializers as described above.

```js twoslash
function Foo(i = null) {
  if (!i) i = 1;
  var j = undefined;
  j = 2;
  this.l = [];
}

var foo = new Foo();
foo.l.push(foo.i);
foo.l.push("end");
```

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
<img src="../../bear.jpg" alt="Logo Zustand" />
</div>

A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution.
Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks.
It isn't boilerplatey or opinionated,
but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.

Don't disregard it because it's cute, it has claws!
Lots of time was spent to deal with common pitfalls,
like the dreaded [zombie child problem],
[React concurrency], and [context loss]
between mixed renderers.
It may be the one state manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

You can try a live demo [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-moon-itop4).

[zombie child problem]: https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#stale-props-and-zombie-children
[react concurrency]: https://github.com/bvaughn/rfcs/blob/useMutableSource/text/0000-use-mutable-source.md
[context loss]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13332

## Installation

Zustand is available as a package on NPM for use:

```bash
# NPM
npm install zustand
# Or, use any package manager of your choice.
```

## First create a store

Your store is a hook!
You can put anything in it: primitives, objects, functions.
The `set` function _merges_ state.

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useBear = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
  updateBears: (newBears) => set({ bears: newBears }),
}))
```

## Then bind your components, and that's it!

You can use the hook anywhere, without the need of providers.
Select your state and the consuming component
will re-render when that state changes.

```jsx
function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useBear((state) => state.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} bears around here...</h1>
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useBear((state) => state.increasePopulation)
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>one up</button>
}
```

title: Comparison
description: How Zustand stacks up against similar libraries
nav: 2
---

Zustand is one of many state management libraries for React.
On this page we will discuss Zustand
in comparison to some of these libraries,
including Redux, Valtio, Jotai, and Recoil.

Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses,
and we will compare key differences and similarities between each.

## Redux

### State Model (vs Redux)

Conceptually, Zustand and Redux are quite similar,
both are based on an immutable state model.
However, Redux requires your app to be wrapped
in context providers; Zustand does not.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  increment: (qty: number) => void
  decrement: (qty: number) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: (qty: number) => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + qty })),
  decrement: (qty: number) => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - qty })),
}))
```

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Action = {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement'
  qty: number
}

type Actions = {
  dispatch: (action: Action) => void
}

const countReducer = (state: State, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + action.qty }
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - action.qty }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  dispatch: (action: Action) => set((state) => countReducer(state, action)),
}))
```

**Redux**

```ts
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Action = {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement'
  qty: number
}

const countReducer = (state: State, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + action.qty }
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - action.qty }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const countStore = createStore(countReducer)
```

```ts
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const countSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'count',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    incremented: (state, qty: number) => {
      // Redux Toolkit does not mutate the state, it uses the Immer library
      // behind scenes, allowing us to have something called "draft state".
      state.value += qty
    },
    decremented: (state, qty: number) => {
      state.value -= qty
    },
  },
})

const countStore = configureStore({ reducer: countSlice.reducer })
```

### Render Optimization (vs Redux)

When it comes to render optimizations within your app,
there are no major differences in approach between Zustand and Redux.
In both libraries it is recommended
that you manually apply render optimizations by using selectors.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  increment: (qty: number) => void
  decrement: (qty: number) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: (qty: number) => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + qty })),
  decrement: (qty: number) => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - qty })),
}))

const Component = () => {
  const count = useCountStore((state) => state.count)
  const increment = useCountStore((state) => state.increment)
  const decrement = useCountStore((state) => state.decrement)
  // ...
}
```

**Redux**

```ts
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Action = {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement'
  qty: number
}

const countReducer = (state: State, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + action.qty }
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - action.qty }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const countStore = createStore(countReducer)

const Component = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.count)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()
  // ...
}
```

```ts
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import type { TypedUseSelectorHook } from 'react-redux'
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const countSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'count',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    incremented: (state, qty: number) => {
      // Redux Toolkit does not mutate the state, it uses the Immer library
      // behind scenes, allowing us to have something called "draft state".
      state.value += qty
    },
    decremented: (state, qty: number) => {
      state.value -= qty
    },
  },
})

const countStore = configureStore({ reducer: countSlice.reducer })

const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<typeof countStore.getState> =
  useSelector

const useAppDispatch: () => typeof countStore.dispatch = useDispatch

const Component = () => {
  const count = useAppSelector((state) => state.count.value)
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
  // ...
}
```

## Valtio

### State Model (vs Valtio)

Zustand and Valtio approach state management
in a fundamentally different way.
Zustand is based on the **immutable** state model,
while Valtio is based on the **mutable** state model.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  obj: { count: number }
}

const store = create<State>(() => ({ obj: { count: 0 } }))

store.setState((prev) => ({ obj: { count: prev.obj.count + 1 } }))
```

**Valtio**

```ts
import { proxy } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({ obj: { count: 0 } })

state.obj.count += 1
```

### Render Optimization (vs Valtio)

The other difference between Zustand and Valtio
is Valtio makes render optimizations through property access.
However, with Zustand, it is recommended that
you manually apply render optimizations by using selectors.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

const useCountStore = create<State>(() => ({
  count: 0,
}))

const Component = () => {
  const count = useCountStore((state) => state.count)
  // ...
}
```

**Valtio**

```ts
import { proxy, useSnapshot } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({
  count: 0,
})

const Component = () => {
  const { count } = useSnapshot(state)
  // ...
}
```

## Jotai

### State Model (vs Jotai)

There is one major difference between Zustand and Jotai.
Zustand is a single store,
while Jotai consists of primitive atoms that can be composed together.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  updateCount: (
    countCallback: (count: State['count']) => State['count'],
  ) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  updateCount: (countCallback) =>
    set((state) => ({ count: countCallback(state.count) })),
}))
```

**Jotai**

```ts
import { atom } from 'jotai'

const countAtom = atom<number>(0)
```

### Render Optimization (vs Jotai)

Jotai achieves render optimizations through atom dependency.
However, with Zustand it is recommended that
you manually apply render optimizations by using selectors.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  updateCount: (
    countCallback: (count: State['count']) => State['count'],
  ) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  updateCount: (countCallback) =>
    set((state) => ({ count: countCallback(state.count) })),
}))

const Component = () => {
  const count = useCountStore((state) => state.count)
  const updateCount = useCountStore((state) => state.updateCount)
  // ...
}
```

**Jotai**

```ts
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'

const countAtom = atom<number>(0)

const Component = () => {
  const [count, updateCount] = useAtom(countAtom)
  // ...
}
```

## Recoil

### State Model (vs Recoil)

The difference between Zustand and Recoil
is similar to that between Zustand and Jotai.
Recoil depends on atom string keys
instead of atom object referential identities.
Additionally, Recoil needs to wrap your app in a context provider.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  setCount: (countCallback: (count: State['count']) => State['count']) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  setCount: (countCallback) =>
    set((state) => ({ count: countCallback(state.count) })),
}))
```

**Recoil**

```ts
import { atom } from 'recoil'

const count = atom({
  key: 'count',
  default: 0,
})
```

### Render Optimization (vs Recoil)

Similar to previous optimization comparisons,
Recoil makes render optimizations through atom dependency.
Whereas with Zustand, it is recommended that
you manually apply render optimizations by using selectors.

**Zustand**

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  setCount: (countCallback: (count: State['count']) => State['count']) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  setCount: (countCallback) =>
    set((state) => ({ count: countCallback(state.count) })),
}))

const Component = () => {
  const count = useCountStore((state) => state.count)
  const setCount = useCountStore((state) => state.setCount)
  // ...
}
```

**Recoil**

```ts
import { atom, useRecoilState } from 'recoil'

const countAtom = atom({
  key: 'count',
  default: 0,
})

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(countAtom)
  // ...
}
```

# Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe

## Building a game

You will build a small tic-tac-toe game during this tutorial. This tutorial does assume existing
React knowledge. The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React
app, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of React and Zustand.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is crafted for those who learn best through hands-on experience and want to swiftly
> create something tangible. It draws inspiration from React's tic-tac-toe tutorial.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- Setup for the tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
- Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
- Completing the game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
- Adding time travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.

### What are you building?

In this tutorial, you'll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React and Zustand.

You can see what it will look like when you're finished here:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useGameStore = create(
  combine(
    {
      history: [Array(9).fill(null)],
      currentMove: 0,
    },
    (set, get) => {
      return {
        setHistory: (nextHistory) => {
          set((state) => ({
            history:
              typeof nextHistory === 'function'
                ? nextHistory(state.history)
                : nextHistory,
          }))
        },
        setCurrentMove: (nextCurrentMove) => {
          set((state) => ({
            currentMove:
              typeof nextCurrentMove === 'function'
                ? nextCurrentMove(state.currentMove)
                : nextCurrentMove,
          }))
        },
      }
    },
  ),
)

function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        display: 'inline-flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',

  const turns = calculateTurns(squares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'
  const status = calculateStatus(winner, turns, player)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i] || winner) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player

export default function Game() {
  const history = useGameStore((state) => state.history)

  const currentMove = useGameStore((state) => state.currentMove)
  const setCurrentMove = useGameStore((state) => state.setCurrentMove)
  const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares]
    setHistory(nextHistory)
    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1)
  }

                </button>
              </li>

}

function calculateStatus(winner, turns, player) {
  if (!winner && !turns) return 'Draw'
  if (winner) return `Winner ${winner}`
  return `Next player: ${player}`
}
```

### Building the board

Let's start by creating the `Square` component, which will be a building block for our `Board`
component. This component will represent each square in our game.

The `Square` component should take `value` and `onSquareClick` as props. It should return a
`<button>` element, styled to look like a square. The button displays the value prop, which can be
`'X'`, `'O'`, or `null`, depending on the game's state. When the button is clicked, it triggers the
`onSquareClick` function passed in as a prop, allowing the game to respond to user input.

Here's the code for the `Square` component:

```jsx
function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        display: 'inline-flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        padding: 0,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        border: '1px solid #999',
        outline: 0,
        borderRadius: 0,
        fontSize: '1rem',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
      }}
      onClick={onSquareClick}
    >
      {value}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Let's move on to creating the Board component, which will consist of 9 squares arranged in a grid.
This component will serve as the main playing area for our game.

The `Board` component should return a `<div>` element styled as a grid. The grid layout is achieved
using CSS Grid, with three columns and three rows, each taking up an equal fraction of the available
space. The overall size of the grid is determined by the width and height properties, ensuring that
it is square-shaped and appropriately sized.

Inside the grid, we place nine Square components, each with a value prop representing its position.
These Square components will eventually hold the game symbols (`'X'` or `'O'`) and handle user
interactions.

Here's the code for the `Board` component:

```jsx
export default function Board() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'grid',
        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        border: '1px solid #999',
      }}
    >
      <Square value="1" />
      <Square value="2" />
      <Square value="3" />
      <Square value="4" />
      <Square value="5" />
      <Square value="6" />
      <Square value="7" />
      <Square value="8" />
      <Square value="9" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This Board component sets up the basic structure for our game board by arranging nine squares in a
3x3 grid. It positions the squares neatly, providing a foundation for adding more features and
handling player interactions in the future.

### Lifting state up

Each `Square` component could maintain a part of the game's state. To check for a winner in a
tic-tac-toe game, the `Board` component would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9
`Square` components.

How would you approach that? At first, you might guess that the `Board` component needs to ask each
`Square` component for that `Square`'s component state. Although this approach is technically
possible in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible
to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game's state in the
parent `Board` component instead of in each `Square` component. The `Board` component can tell each
`Square` component what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each
`Square` component.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To collect data from multiple children, or to have two or more child components
> communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The
> parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child
> components in sync with each other and with their parent.

Let's take this opportunity to try it out. Edit the `Board` component so that it declares a state
variable named squares that defaults to an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useGameStore = create(
  combine({ squares: Array(9).fill(null) }, (set) => {
    return {
      setSquares: (nextSquares) => {
        set((state) => ({
          squares:
            typeof nextSquares === 'function'
              ? nextSquares(state.squares)
              : nextSquares,
        }))
      },
    }
  }),
)

export default function Board() {
  const squares = useGameStore((state) => state.squares)
  const setSquares = useGameStore((state) => state.setSquares)

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'grid',
        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        border: '1px solid #999',
      }}
    >
      {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
        <Square key={squareIndex} value={square} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

`Array(9).fill(null)` creates an array with nine elements and sets each of them to `null`. The
`useGameStore` declares a `squares` state that's initially set to that array. Each entry in the
array corresponds to the value of a square. When you fill the board in later, the squares array
will look like this:

```js
const squares = ['O', null, 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', null, null]
```

Each Square will now receive a `value` prop that will either be `'X'`, `'O'`, or `null` for empty
squares.

Next, you need to change what happens when a `Square` component is clicked. The `Board` component
now maintains which squares are filled. You'll need to create a way for the `Square` component to
update the `Board`'s component state. Since state is private to a component that defines it, you
cannot update the `Board`'s component state directly from `Square` component.

Instead, you'll pass down a function from the Board component to the `Square` component, and you'll
have `Square` component call that function when a square is clicked. You'll start with the function
that the `Square` component will call when it is clicked. You'll call that function `onSquareClick`:

Now you'll connect the `onSquareClick` prop to a function in the `Board` component that you'll name
`handleClick`. To connect `onSquareClick` to `handleClick` you'll pass an inline function to the
`onSquareClick` prop of the first Square component:

```jsx
<Square key={squareIndex} value={square} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(i)} />
```

Lastly, you will define the `handleClick` function inside the `Board` component to update the
squares array holding your board's state.

The `handleClick` function should take the index of the square to update and create a copy of the
`squares` array (`nextSquares`). Then, `handleClick` updates the `nextSquares` array by adding `X`
to the square at the specified index (`i`) if is not already filled.

```jsx {5-10,27}
export default function Board() {
  const squares = useGameStore((state) => state.squares)
  const setSquares = useGameStore((state) => state.setSquares)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i]) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = 'X'
    setSquares(nextSquares)
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'grid',
        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        border: '1px solid #999',
      }}
    >
      {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
        <Square
          key={squareIndex}
          value={square}
          onSquareClick={() => handleClick(squareIndex)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note how in `handleClick` function, you call `.slice()` to create a copy of the squares array
> instead of modifying the existing array.

### Taking turns

It's now time to fix a major defect in this tic-tac-toe game: the `'O'`s cannot be used on the
board.

You'll set the first move to be `'X'` by default. Let's keep track of this by adding another piece
of state to the `useGameStore` hook:

```jsx {2,12-18}
const useGameStore = create(
  combine({ squares: Array(9).fill(null), xIsNext: true }, (set) => {
    return {
      setSquares: (nextSquares) => {
        set((state) => ({
          squares:
            typeof nextSquares === 'function'
              ? nextSquares(state.squares)
              : nextSquares,
        }))
      },
      setXIsNext: (nextXIsNext) => {
        set((state) => ({
          xIsNext:
            typeof nextXIsNext === 'function'
              ? nextXIsNext(state.xIsNext)
              : nextXIsNext,
        }))
      },
    }
  }),
)
```

Each time a player moves, `xIsNext` (a boolean) will be flipped to determine which player goes next
and the game's state will be saved. You'll update the Board's `handleClick` function to flip the
value of `xIsNext`:

```jsx {2-3,6,11}
export default function Board() {
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const squares = useGameStore((state) => state.squares)
  const setSquares = useGameStore((state) => state.setSquares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i]) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player
    setSquares(nextSquares)
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'grid',
        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
        border: '1px solid #999',
      }}
    >
      {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
        <Square
          key={squareIndex}
          value={square}
          onSquareClick={() => handleClick(squareIndex)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Declaring a winner or draw

Now that the players can take turns, you'll want to show when the game is won or drawn and there
are no more turns to make. To do this you'll add three helper functions. The first helper function
called `calculateWinner` that takes an array of 9 squares, checks for a winner and returns `'X'`,
`'O'`, or `null` as appropriate. The second helper function called `calculateTurns` that takes the
same array, checks for remaining turns by filtering out only `null` items, and returns the count of
them. The last helper called `calculateStatus` that takes the remaining turns, the winner, and the
current player (`'X' or 'O'`):

```js
function calculateWinner(squares) {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ]

  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i]
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a]
    }
  }

  return null
}

function calculateTurns(squares) {
  return squares.filter((square) => !square).length
}

function calculateStatus(winner, turns, player) {
  if (!winner && !turns) return 'Draw'
  if (winner) return `Winner ${winner}`
  return `Next player: ${player}`
}
```

You will use the result of `calculateWinner(squares)` in the Board component's `handleClick`
function to check if a player has won. You can perform this check at the same time you check if a
user has clicked a square that already has a `'X'` or and `'O'`. We'd like to return early in
both cases:

```js {2}
function handleClick(i) {
  if (squares[i] || winner) return
  const nextSquares = squares.slice()
  nextSquares[i] = player
  setSquares(nextSquares)
  setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
}
```

To let the players know when the game is over, you can display text such as `'Winner: X'` or
`'Winner: O'`. To do that you'll add a `status` section to the `Board` component. The status will
display the winner or draw if the game is over and if the game is ongoing you'll display which
player's turn is next:

```jsx {6-7,9,21}
export default function Board() {
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const squares = useGameStore((state) => state.squares)
  const setSquares = useGameStore((state) => state.setSquares)
  const winner = calculateWinner(squares)
  const turns = calculateTurns(squares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'
  const status = calculateStatus(winner, turns, player)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i] || winner) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player
    setSquares(nextSquares)
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>{status}</div>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'grid',
          gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          border: '1px solid #999',
        }}
      >
        {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
          <Square
            key={squareIndex}
            value={square}
            onSquareClick={() => handleClick(squareIndex)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

Congratulations! You now have a working tic-tac-toe game. And you've just learned the basics of
React and Zustand too. So you are the real winner here. Here is what the code should look like:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useGameStore = create(
  combine({ squares: Array(9).fill(null), xIsNext: true }, (set) => {
    return {
      setSquares: (nextSquares) => {
        set((state) => ({
          squares:
            typeof nextSquares === 'function'
              ? nextSquares(state.squares)
              : nextSquares,
        }))
      },
      setXIsNext: (nextXIsNext) => {
        set((state) => ({
          xIsNext:
            typeof nextXIsNext === 'function'
              ? nextXIsNext(state.xIsNext)
              : nextXIsNext,
        }))
      },
    }
  }),
)

function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        display: 'inline-flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        padding: 0,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        border: '1px solid #999',
        outline: 0,
        borderRadius: 0,
        fontSize: '1rem',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
      }}
      onClick={onSquareClick}
    >
      {value}
    </button>
  )
}

export default function Board() {
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const squares = useGameStore((state) => state.squares)
  const setSquares = useGameStore((state) => state.setSquares)
  const winner = calculateWinner(squares)
  const turns = calculateTurns(squares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'
  const status = calculateStatus(winner, turns, player)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i] || winner) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player
    setSquares(nextSquares)
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  return (

      <div

        }}
      >
        {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (

  )
}

function calculateWinner(squares) {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ]

  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i]
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a]
    }
  }

  return null
}

function calculateTurns(squares) {
  return squares.filter((square) => !square).length
}

function calculateStatus(winner, turns, player) {
  if (!winner && !turns) return 'Draw'
  if (winner) return `Winner ${winner}`
  return `Next player: ${player}`
}
```

### Adding time travel

As a final exercise, let's make it possible to “go back in time” and revisit previous moves in the
game.

If you had directly modified the squares array, implementing this time-travel feature would be very
difficult. However, since you used `slice()` to create a new copy of the squares array after every
move, treating it as immutable, you can store every past version of the squares array and navigate
between them.

You'll keep track of these past squares arrays in a new state variable called `history`. This
`history` array will store all board states, from the first move to the latest one, and will look
something like this:

```js
const history = [
  // First move
  [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
  // Second move
  ['X', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
  // Third move
  ['X', 'O', null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
  // and so on...
]
```

This approach allows you to easily navigate between different game states and implement the
time-travel feature.

### Lifting state up, again

Next, you will create a new top-level component called `Game` to display a list of past moves. This
is where you will store the `history` state that contains the entire game history.

By placing the `history` state in the `Game` component, you can remove the `squares` state from the
`Board` component. You will now lift the state up from the `Board` component to the top-level `Game`
component. This change allows the `Game` component to have full control over the `Board`'s
component data and instruct the `Board` component to render previous turns from the `history`.

First, add a `Game` component with `export default` and remove it from `Board` component. Here is
what the code should look like:

```jsx {1,44-61}
function Board() {
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const squares = useGameStore((state) => state.squares)
  const setSquares = useGameStore((state) => state.setSquares)
  const winner = calculateWinner(squares)
  const turns = calculateTurns(squares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'
  const status = calculateStatus(winner, turns, player)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i] || winner) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player
    setSquares(nextSquares)
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>{status}</div>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'grid',
          gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          border: '1px solid #999',
        }}
      >
        {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
          <Square
            key={squareIndex}
            value={square}
            onSquareClick={() => handleClick(squareIndex)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default function Game() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        fontFamily: 'monospace',
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>{/* TODO */}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Add some state to the `useGameStore` hook to track the history of moves:

```js {2,4-11}
const useGameStore = create(
  combine({ history: [Array(9).fill(null)], xIsNext: true }, (set) => {
    return {
      setHistory: (nextHistory) => {
        set((state) => ({
          history:
            typeof nextHistory === 'function'
              ? nextHistory(state.history)
              : nextHistory,
        }))
      },
      setXIsNext: (nextXIsNext) => {
        set((state) => ({
          xIsNext:
            typeof nextXIsNext === 'function'
              ? nextXIsNext(state.xIsNext)
              : nextXIsNext,
        }))
      },
    }
  }),
)
```

Notice how `[Array(9).fill(null)]` creates an array with a single item, which is itself an array of
9 null values.

To render the squares for the current move, you'll need to read the most recent squares array from
the `history` state. You don't need an extra state for this because you already have enough
information to calculate it during rendering:

```jsx {2-6}
export default function Game() {
  const history = useGameStore((state) => state.history)
  const setHistory = useGameStore((state) => state.setHistory)
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1]

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        fontFamily: 'monospace',
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Next, create a `handlePlay` function inside the `Game` component that will be called by the `Board`
component to update the game. Pass `xIsNext`, `currentSquares` and `handlePlay` as props to the
`Board` component:

```jsx {8-10,21}
export default function Game() {
  const history = useGameStore((state) => state.history)
  const setHistory = useGameStore((state) => state.setHistory)
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1]

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    // TODO
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        fontFamily: 'monospace',
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Let's make the `Board` component fully controlled by the props it receives. To do this, we'll modify
the `Board` component to accept three props: `xIsNext`, `squares`, and a new `onPlay` function that
the `Board` component can call with the updated squares array when a player makes a move.

```jsx {1}
function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {
  const winner = calculateWinner(squares)
  const turns = calculateTurns(squares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'
  const status = calculateStatus(winner, turns, player)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i] || winner) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player
    onPlay(nextSquares)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>{status}</div>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'grid',
          gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          border: '1px solid #999',
        }}
      >
        {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
          <Square
            key={squareIndex}
            value={square}
            onSquareClick={() => handleClick(squareIndex)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

The `Board` component is now fully controlled by the props passed to it by the `Game` component. To
get the game working again, you need to implement the `handlePlay` function in the `Game`
component.

What should `handlePlay` do when called? Previously, the `Board` component called `setSquares` with
an updated array; now it passes the updated squares array to `onPlay`.

The `handlePlay` function needs to update the `Game` component's state to trigger a re-render.
Instead of using `setSquares`, you'll update the `history` state variable by appending the updated
squares array as a new `history` entry. You also need to toggle `xIsNext`, just as the `Board`
component used
to do.

```js {2-3}
function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
  setHistory(history.concat([nextSquares]))
  setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
}
```

At this point, you've moved the state to live in the `Game` component, and the UI should be fully
working, just as it was before the refactor. Here is what the code should look like at this point:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useGameStore = create(
  combine({ history: [Array(9).fill(null)], xIsNext: true }, (set) => {
    return {
      setHistory: (nextHistory) => {
        set((state) => ({
          history:
            typeof nextHistory === 'function'
              ? nextHistory(state.history)
              : nextHistory,
        }))
      },
      setXIsNext: (nextXIsNext) => {
        set((state) => ({
          xIsNext:
            typeof nextXIsNext === 'function'
              ? nextXIsNext(state.xIsNext)
              : nextXIsNext,
        }))
      },
    }
  }),
)

function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        display: 'inline-flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        padding: 0,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        border: '1px solid #999',
        outline: 0,
        borderRadius: 0,
        fontSize: '1rem',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
      }}
      onClick={onSquareClick}
    >
      {value}
    </button>
  )
}

function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {
  const winner = calculateWinner(squares)
  const turns = calculateTurns(squares)
  const player = xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'
  const status = calculateStatus(winner, turns, player)

  function handleClick(i) {
    if (squares[i] || winner) return
    const nextSquares = squares.slice()
    nextSquares[i] = player
    onPlay(nextSquares)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>{status}</div>
      <div

          gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
          width: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          height: 'calc(3 * 2.5rem)',
          border: '1px solid #999',
        }}
      >
        {squares.map((square, squareIndex) => (
          <Square
            key={squareIndex}
            value={square}
            onSquareClick={() => handleClick(squareIndex)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default function Game() {

  const setHistory = useGameStore((state) => state.setHistory)
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1]

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    setHistory(history.concat([nextSquares]))
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  return (

      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

function calculateWinner(squares) {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],

  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i]
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a]
    }
  }

  return null
}

function calculateTurns(squares) {
  return squares.filter((square) => !square).length
}

function calculateStatus(winner, turns, player) {
  if (!winner && !turns) return 'Draw'
  if (winner) return `Winner ${winner}`
  return `Next player: ${player}`
}
```

### Showing the past moves

Since you are recording the tic-tac-toe game's history, you can now display a list of past moves to
the player.

You already have an array of `history` moves in store, so now you need to transform it to an array
of React elements. In JavaScript, to transform one array into another, you can use the Array
`.map()` method:

You'll use `map` to transform your `history` of moves into React elements representing buttons on the
screen, and display a list of buttons to **jump** to past moves. Let's `map` over the `history` in
the `Game` component:

```jsx {29-44}
export default function Game() {
  const history = useGameStore((state) => state.history)
  const setHistory = useGameStore((state) => state.setHistory)
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1]

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    setHistory(history.concat([nextSquares]))
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  function jumpTo(nextMove) {
    // TODO
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        fontFamily: 'monospace',
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>
          {history.map((_, historyIndex) => {
            const description =
              historyIndex > 0
                ? `Go to move #${historyIndex}`
                : 'Go to game start'

            return (
              <li key={historyIndex}>
                <button onClick={() => jumpTo(historyIndex)}>
                  {description}
                </button>
              </li>
            )
          })}
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Before you can implement the `jumpTo` function, you need the `Game` component to keep track of which
step the user is currently viewing. To do this, define a new state variable called `currentMove`,
which will start at `0`:

```js {3,14-21}
const useGameStore = create(
  combine(
    { history: [Array(9).fill(null)], currentMove: 0, xIsNext: true },
    (set) => {
      return {
        setHistory: (nextHistory) => {
          set((state) => ({
            history:
              typeof nextHistory === 'function'
                ? nextHistory(state.history)
                : nextHistory,
          }))
        },
        setCurrentMove: (nextCurrentMove) => {
          set((state) => ({
            currentMove:
              typeof nextCurrentMove === 'function'
                ? nextCurrentMove(state.currentMove)
                : nextCurrentMove,
          }))
        },
        setXIsNext: (nextXIsNext) => {
          set((state) => ({
            xIsNext:
              typeof nextXIsNext === 'function'
                ? nextXIsNext(state.xIsNext)
                : nextXIsNext,
          }))
        },
      }
    },
  ),
)
```

Next, update the `jumpTo` function inside `Game` component to update that `currentMove`. You’ll
also set `xIsNext` to `true` if the number that you’re changing `currentMove` to is even.

```js {2-3}
function jumpTo(nextMove) {
  setCurrentMove(nextMove)
  setXIsNext(currentMove % 2 === 0)
}
```

You will now make two changes to the `handlePlay` function in the `Game` component, which is called
when you click on a square.

- If you "go back in time" and then make a new move from that point, you only want to keep the
  history up to that point. Instead of adding `nextSquares` after all items in the history (using
  the Array `.concat()` method), you'll add it after all items in
  `history.slice(0, currentMove + 1)` to keep only that portion of the old history.
- Each time a move is made, you need to update `currentMove` to point to the latest history entry.

```js {2-4}
function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
  const nextHistory = history.slice(0, currentMove + 1).concat([nextSquares])
  setHistory(nextHistory)
  setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1)
  setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
}
```

Finally, you will modify the `Game` component to render the currently selected move, instead of
always rendering the final move:

```jsx {2-8}
export default function Game() {
  const history = useGameStore((state) => state.history)
  const setHistory = useGameStore((state) => state.setHistory)
  const currentMove = useGameStore((state) => state.currentMove)
  const setCurrentMove = useGameStore((state) => state.setCurrentMove)
  const xIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.xIsNext)
  const setXIsNext = useGameStore((state) => state.setXIsNext)
  const currentSquares = history[currentMove]

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    const nextHistory = history.slice(0, currentMove + 1).concat([nextSquares])
    setHistory(nextHistory)
    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1)
    setXIsNext(!xIsNext)
  }

  function jumpTo(nextMove) {
    setCurrentMove(nextMove)
    setXIsNext(nextMove % 2 === 0)
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        fontFamily: 'monospace',
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>
          {history.map((_, historyIndex) => {
            const description =
              historyIndex > 0
                ? `Go to move #${historyIndex}`
                : 'Go to game start'

            return (
              <li key={historyIndex}>
                <button onClick={() => jumpTo(historyIndex)}>
                  {description}
                </button>
              </li>
            )
          })}
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Final cleanup

If you look closely at the code, you'll see that `xIsNext` is `true` when `currentMove` is even and
`false` when `currentMove` is odd. This means that if you know the value of `currentMove`, you can
always determine what `xIsNext` should be.

There's no need to store `xIsNext` separately in the state. It’s better to avoid redundant state
because it can reduce bugs and make your code easier to understand. Instead, you can calculate
`xIsNext` based on `currentMove`:

```jsx {2-5,13,17}
export default function Game() {
  const history = useGameStore((state) => state.history)
  const setHistory = useGameStore((state) => state.setHistory)
  const currentMove = useGameStore((state) => state.currentMove)
  const setCurrentMove = useGameStore((state) => state.setCurrentMove)
  const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0
  const currentSquares = history[currentMove]

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    const nextHistory = history.slice(0, currentMove + 1).concat([nextSquares])
    setHistory(nextHistory)
    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1)
  }

  function jumpTo(nextMove) {
    setCurrentMove(nextMove)
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        fontFamily: 'monospace',
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        <ol>
          {history.map((_, historyIndex) => {
            const description =
              historyIndex > 0
                ? `Go to move #${historyIndex}`
                : 'Go to game start'

            return (
              <li key={historyIndex}>
                <button onClick={() => jumpTo(historyIndex)}>
                  {description}
                </button>
              </li>
            )
          })}
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You no longer need the `xIsNext` state declaration or the calls to `setXIsNext`. Now, there’s no
chance for `xIsNext` to get out of sync with `currentMove`, even if you make a mistake while coding
the components.

### Wrapping up

Congratulations! You’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game or when is drawn,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

Nice work! We hope you now feel like you have a decent grasp of how React and Zustand works.


<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/updating-state.md -->

---
title: Updating state
nav: 4
---

## Flat updates

Updating state with Zustand is simple! Call the provided `set` function with
the new state, and it will be shallowly merged with the existing state in the
store. **Note** See next section for nested state.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

type Action = {
  updateFirstName: (firstName: State['firstName']) => void
  updateLastName: (lastName: State['lastName']) => void
}

// Create your store, which includes both state and (optionally) actions
const usePersonStore = create<State & Action>((set) => ({
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
  updateFirstName: (firstName) => set(() => ({ firstName: firstName })),
  updateLastName: (lastName) => set(() => ({ lastName: lastName })),
}))

// In consuming app
function App() {
  // "select" the needed state and actions, in this case, the firstName value
  // and the action updateFirstName
  const firstName = usePersonStore((state) => state.firstName)
  const updateFirstName = usePersonStore((state) => state.updateFirstName)

  return (
    <main>
      <label>
        First name
        <input
          // Update the "firstName" state
          onChange={(e) => updateFirstName(e.currentTarget.value)}
          value={firstName}
        />
      </label>

      <p>
        Hello, <strong>{firstName}!</strong>
      </p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Deeply nested object

If you have a deep state object like this:

```ts
type State = {
  deep: {
    nested: {
      obj: { count: number }
    }
  }
}
```

Updating nested state requires some effort to ensure the process is completed
immutably.

### Normal approach

Similar to React or Redux, the normal approach is to copy each level of the
state object. This is done with the spread operator `...`, and by manually
merging that in with the new state values. Like so:

```ts
  normalInc: () =>
    set((state) => ({
      deep: {
        ...state.deep,
        nested: {
          ...state.deep.nested,
          obj: {
            ...state.deep.nested.obj,
            count: state.deep.nested.obj.count + 1
          }
        }
      }
    })),
```

This is very long! Let's explore some alternatives that will make your life
easier.

### With Immer

Many people use [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) to update nested
values. Immer can be used anytime you need to update nested state such as in
React, Redux and of course, Zustand!

You can use Immer to shorten your state updates for deeply nested object. Let's
take a look at an example:

```ts
  immerInc: () =>
    set(produce((state: State) => { ++state.deep.nested.obj.count })),
```

What a reduction! Please take note of the [gotchas listed here](../../reference/integrations/immer-middleware.md).

### With optics-ts

There is another option with [optics-ts](https://github.com/akheron/optics-ts/):

```ts
  opticsInc: () =>
    set(O.modify(O.optic<State>().path("deep.nested.obj.count"))((c) => c + 1)),
```

Unlike Immer, optics-ts doesn't use proxies or mutation syntax.

### With Ramda

You can also use [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/):

```ts
  ramdaInc: () =>
    set(R.modifyPath(["deep", "nested", "obj", "count"], (c) => c + 1)),
```

Both ramda and optics-ts also work with types.

### Demo

<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/practice-with-no-store-actions.md -->

---
title: Practice with no store actions
nav: 5
---

The recommended usage is to colocate actions and states within the store (let your actions be located together with your state).

For example:

```js
export const useBoundStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  setText: (text) => set({ text }),
}))
```

This creates a self-contained store with data and actions together.

---

An alternative approach is to define actions at module level, external to the store.

```js
export const useBoundStore = create(() => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
}))

export const inc = () =>
  useBoundStore.setState((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))

export const setText = (text) => useBoundStore.setState({ text })
```

This has a few advantages:

- It doesn't require a hook to call an action;
- It facilitates code splitting.

While this pattern doesn't offer any downsides, some may prefer colocating due to its encapsulated nature.

## Slicing the store into smaller stores

Your store can become bigger and bigger and tougher to maintain as you add more features.

You can divide your main store into smaller individual stores to achieve modularity. This is simple to accomplish in Zustand!

The first individual store:

```js
export const createFishSlice = (set) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  addFish: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 })),
})
```

Another individual store:

```js
export const createBearSlice = (set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addBear: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  eatFish: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes - 1 })),
})
```

You can now combine both the stores into **one bounded store**:

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { createBearSlice } from './bearSlice'
import { createFishSlice } from './fishSlice'

export const useBoundStore = create((...a) => ({
  ...createBearSlice(...a),
  ...createFishSlice(...a),
}))
```

### Usage in a React component

```jsx
import { useBoundStore } from './stores/useBoundStore'

function App() {
  const bears = useBoundStore((state) => state.bears)
  const fishes = useBoundStore((state) => state.fishes)
  const addBear = useBoundStore((state) => state.addBear)
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Number of bears: {bears}</h2>
      <h2>Number of fishes: {fishes}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => addBear()}>Add a bear</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Updating multiple stores

You can update multiple stores, at the same time, in a single function.

```js
export const createBearFishSlice = (set, get) => ({
  addBearAndFish: () => {
    get().addBear()
    get().addFish()
  },
})
```

Combining all the stores together is the same as before.

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { createBearSlice } from './bearSlice'
import { createFishSlice } from './fishSlice'
import { createBearFishSlice } from './createBearFishSlice'

export const useBoundStore = create((...a) => ({
  ...createBearSlice(...a),
  ...createFishSlice(...a),
  ...createBearFishSlice(...a),
}))
```

## Adding middlewares

Adding middlewares to a combined store is the same as with other normal stores.

Adding [`persist` middleware](../../reference/integrations/persisting-store-data.md) to our `useBoundStore`:

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { createBearSlice } from './bearSlice'
import { createFishSlice } from './fishSlice'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (...a) => ({
      ...createBearSlice(...a),
      ...createFishSlice(...a),
    }),
    { name: 'bound-store' },
  ),
)
```

Please keep in mind you should only apply middlewares in the combined store. Applying them inside individual slices can lead to unexpected issues.

## Usage with TypeScript

A detailed guide on how to use the slice pattern in Zustand with TypeScript can be found [here](./advanced-typescript.md#slices-pattern).


<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/immutable-state-and-merging.md -->

---
title: Immutable state and merging
nav: 7
---

Like with React's `useState`, we need to update state immutably.

Here's a typical example:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}))
```

The `set` function is to update state in the store.
Because the state is immutable, it should have been like this:

```js
set((state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }))
```

However, as this is a common pattern, `set` actually merges state, and
we can skip the `...state` part:

```js
set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
```

## Nested objects

The `set` function merges state at only one level.
If you have a nested object, you need to merge them explicitly. You will use the spread operator pattern like so:

```jsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  inc: () =>
    set((state) => ({
      nested: { ...state.nested, count: state.nested.count + 1 },
    })),
}))
```

For complex use cases, consider using some libraries that help with immutable updates.
You can refer to [Updating nested state object values](./updating-state.md#deeply-nested-object).

## Replace flag

To disable the merging behavior, you can specify a `replace` boolean value for `set` like so:

```js
set((state) => newState, true)
```


<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/maps-and-sets-usage.md -->

---
title: Map and Set Usage
nav: 8
---

# Map and Set in Zustand

Map and Set are mutable data structures. To use them in Zustand, you must create new instances when updating.

## Map

### Reading a Map

```typescript
const foo = useSomeStore((state) => state.foo)
```

### Updating a Map

Always create a new Map instance:

```ts
// Update single entry
set((state) => ({
  foo: new Map(state.foo).set(key, value),
}))

// Delete entry
set((state) => {
  const next = new Map(state.foo)
  next.delete(key)
  return { foo: next }
})

// Update multiple entries
set((state) => {
  const next = new Map(state.foo)
  next.set('key1', 'value1')
  next.set('key2', 'value2')
  return { foo: next }
})

// Clear
set({ foo: new Map() })
```

## Set

### Reading a Set

```ts
const bar = useSomeStore((state) => state.bar)
```

### Updating a Set

Always create a new Set instance:

```ts
// Add item
set((state) => ({
  bar: new Set(state.bar).add(item),
}))

// Delete item
set((state) => {
  const next = new Set(state.bar)
  next.delete(item)
  return { bar: next }
})

// Toggle item
set((state) => {
  const next = new Set(state.bar)
  next.has(item) ? next.delete(item) : next.add(item)
  return { bar: next }
})

// Clear
set({ bar: new Set() })
```

## Why New Instances?

Zustand detects changes by comparing references. Mutating a Map or Set doesn't change its reference:

```ts
// ❌ Wrong - same reference, no re-render
set((state) => {
  state.foo.set(key, value)
  return { foo: state.foo }
})

// ✅ Correct - new reference, triggers re-render
set((state) => ({
  foo: new Map(state.foo).set(key, value),
}))
```

## Pitfall: Type Hints for Empty Collections

Provide type hints when initializing empty Maps and Sets:

```ts
{
  ids: new Set([] as string[]),
  users: new Map([] as [string, User][])
}
```

Without type hints, TypeScript infers `never[]` which prevents adding items later.

<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/prevent-rerenders-with-use-shallow.md -->

---
title: Prevent rerenders with useShallow
nav: 9
---

When you need to subscribe to a computed state from a store, the recommended way is to
use a selector.

The computed selector will cause a rerender if the output has changed according to [Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is?retiredLocale=it).

In this case you might want to use `useShallow` to avoid a rerender if the computed value is always shallow
equal the previous one.

## Example

We have a store that associates to each bear a meal and we want to render their names.

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useMeals = create(() => ({
  papaBear: 'large porridge-pot',
  mamaBear: 'middle-size porridge pot',
  littleBear: 'A little, small, wee pot',
}))

export const BearNames = () => {
  const names = useMeals((state) => Object.keys(state))

  return <div>{names.join(', ')}</div>
}
```

Now papa bear wants a pizza instead:

```js
useMeals.setState({
  papaBear: 'a large pizza',
})
```

This change causes `BearNames` rerenders even though the actual output of `names` has not changed according to shallow equal.

We can fix that using `useShallow`!

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/react/shallow'

const useMeals = create(() => ({
  papaBear: 'large porridge-pot',
  mamaBear: 'middle-size porridge pot',
  littleBear: 'A little, small, wee pot',
}))

export const BearNames = () => {
  const names = useMeals(useShallow((state) => Object.keys(state)))

  return <div>{names.join(', ')}</div>
}
```

Now they can all order other meals without causing unnecessary rerenders of our `BearNames` component.

---
title: Connect to state with URL
nav: 10
---

## Connect State with URL Hash

If you want to connect state of a store to URL hash, you can create your own hash storage.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, StateStorage, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

const hashStorage: StateStorage = {
  getItem: (key): string => {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1))
    const storedValue = searchParams.get(key) ?? ''
    return JSON.parse(storedValue)
  },
  setItem: (key, newValue): void => {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1))
    searchParams.set(key, JSON.stringify(newValue))
    location.hash = searchParams.toString()
  },
  removeItem: (key): void => {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1))
    searchParams.delete(key)
    location.hash = searchParams.toString()
  },
}

export const useBoundStore = create()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      fishes: 0,
      addAFish: () => set({ fishes: get().fishes + 1 }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage', // unique name
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => hashStorage),
    },
  ),
)
```

## Persist and Connect State with URL Parameters (Example: URL Query Parameters)

There are times when you want to conditionally connect the state to the URL.
This example depicts usage of the URL query parameters
while keeping it synced with another persistence implementation, like `localstorage`.

If you want the URL params to always populate, the conditional check on `getUrlSearch()` can be removed.

The implementation below will update the URL in place, without refresh, as the relevant states change.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, StateStorage, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

const getUrlSearch = () => {
  return window.location.search.slice(1)
}

const persistentStorage: StateStorage = {
  getItem: (key): string => {
    // Check URL first
    if (getUrlSearch()) {
      const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(getUrlSearch())
      const storedValue = searchParams.get(key)
      return JSON.parse(storedValue as string)
    } else {
      // Otherwise, we should load from localstorage or alternative storage
      return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) as string)
    }
  },
  setItem: (key, newValue): void => {
    // Check if query params exist at all, can remove check if always want to set URL
    if (getUrlSearch()) {
      const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(getUrlSearch())
      searchParams.set(key, JSON.stringify(newValue))
      window.history.replaceState(null, '', `?${searchParams.toString()}`)
    }

    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(newValue))
  },
  removeItem: (key): void => {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(getUrlSearch())
    searchParams.delete(key)
    window.location.search = searchParams.toString()
  },
}

type LocalAndUrlStore = {
  typesOfFish: string[]
  addTypeOfFish: (fishType: string) => void
  numberOfBears: number
  setNumberOfBears: (newNumber: number) => void
}

const storageOptions = {
  name: 'fishAndBearsStore',
  storage: createJSONStorage<LocalAndUrlStore>(() => persistentStorage),
}

const useLocalAndUrlStore = create()(
  persist<LocalAndUrlStore>(
    (set) => ({
      typesOfFish: [],
      addTypeOfFish: (fishType) =>
        set((state) => ({ typesOfFish: [...state.typesOfFish, fishType] })),

      numberOfBears: 0,
      setNumberOfBears: (numberOfBears) => set(() => ({ numberOfBears })),
    }),
    storageOptions,
  ),
)

export default useLocalAndUrlStore
```

When generating the URL from a component, you can call buildShareableUrl:

```ts
const buildURLSuffix = (params, version = 0) => {
  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams()

  const zustandStoreParams = {
    state: {
      typesOfFish: params.typesOfFish,
      numberOfBears: params.numberOfBears,
    },
    version: version, // version is here because that is included with how Zustand sets the state
  }

  // The URL param key should match the name of the store, as specified as in storageOptions above
  searchParams.set('fishAndBearsStore', JSON.stringify(zustandStoreParams))
  return searchParams.toString()
}

export const buildShareableUrl = (params, version) => {
  return `${window.location.origin}?${buildURLSuffix(params, version)}`
}
```

The generated URL would look like (here without any encoding, for readability):

`https://localhost/search?fishAndBearsStore={"state":{"typesOfFish":["tilapia","salmon"],"numberOfBears":15},"version":0}}`

title: Calling actions outside a React event handler in pre React 18
nav: 11
---

Because React handles `setState` synchronously if it's called outside an event handler, updating the state outside an event handler will force react to update the components synchronously. Therefore, there is a risk of encountering the zombie-child effect.
In order to fix this, the action needs to be wrapped in `unstable_batchedUpdates` like so:

```jsx
import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from 'react-dom' // or 'react-native'

const useFishStore = create((set) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  increaseFishes: () => set((prev) => ({ fishes: prev.fishes + 1 })),
}))

const nonReactCallback = () => {
  unstable_batchedUpdates(() => {
    useFishStore.getState().increaseFishes()
  })
}
```

title: Beginner TypeScript Guide

Zustand is a lightweight state manager, particularly used with React. Zustand avoids reducers, context, and boilerplate.
Paired with TypeScript, you get a strongly typed store-state, actions, and selectors-with autocomplete and compile-time safety.

In this basic guide we’ll cover:

- Creating a typed store (state + actions)
- Using the store in React components with type safety
- Resetting the store safely with types
- Extracting and reusing Store type (for props, tests, and utilities)
- Composing multiple selectors and building derived state (with type inference and without extra re-renders)
- Middlewares with TypeScript support (`combine`, `devtools`, `persist`)
- Async actions with typed API responses
- Working with `createWithEqualityFn` (enhanced `create` store function)
- Structuring and coordinating multiple stores

### Creating a Store with State & Actions

Here we describe state and actions using an Typescript interface. The `<BearState>` generic forces the store to match this shape.
This means if you forget a field or use the wrong type, TypeScript will complain. Unlike plain JS, this guarantees type-safe state management.
The `create` function uses the curried form, which results in a store of type `UseBoundStore<StoreApi<BearState>>`.

```ts
// store.ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

// Define types for state & actions
interface BearState {
  bears: number
  food: string
  feed: (food: string) => void
}

// Create store using the curried form of `create`
export const useBearStore = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 2,
  food: 'honey',
  feed: (food) => set(() => ({ food })),
}))
```

### Using the Store in Components

Inside components, you can read state and call actions. Selectors `(s) => s.bears` subscribe to only what you need.
This reduces re-renders and improves performance. JS can do this too, but with TS your IDE autocompletes state fields.

```tsx
import { useBearStore } from './store'

function BearCounter() {
  // Select only 'bears' to avoid unnecessary re-renders
  const bears = useBearStore((s) => s.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} bears around</h1>
}
```

### Resetting the Store

Resetting is useful after logout or “clear session”. We use `typeof initialState` to avoid repeating property types.
TypeScript updates automatically if `initialState` changes. This is safer and cleaner compared to JS.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

const initialState = { bears: 0, food: 'honey' }

// Reuse state type dynamically
type BearState = typeof initialState & {
  increase: (by: number) => void
  reset: () => void
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  ...initialState,
  increase: (by) => set((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + by })),
  reset: () => set(initialState),
}))

function ResetZoo() {
  const { bears, increase, reset } = useBearStore()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{bears}</div>
      <button onClick={() => increase(5)}>Increase by 5</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Extracting Types

Zustand provides a built-in helper called `ExtractState`. This is useful for tests, utility functions, or component props.
It returns the full type of your store’s state and actions without having to manually redefine them. Extracting the Store type:

```ts
// store.ts
import { create, type ExtractState } from 'zustand'

export const useBearStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 3,
  food: 'honey',
  increase: (by: number) => set((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + by })),
}))

// Extract the type of the whole store state
export type BearState = ExtractState<typeof useBearStore>
```

Using extracted type in tests:

```ts
// test.cy.ts
import { BearState } from './store.ts'

test('should reset store', () => {
  const snapshot: BearState = useBearStore.getState()
  expect(snapshot.bears).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)
})
```

and in utility function:

```ts
// util.ts
import { BearState } from './store.ts'

function logBearState(state: BearState) {
  console.log(`We have ${state.bears} bears eating ${state.food}`)
}

logBearState(useBearStore.getState())
```

### Selectors

#### Multiple Selectors

Sometimes you need more than one property. Returning an object from the selector lets you access multiple fields at once.
However, directly destructuring properties from that object can cause unnecessary re-renders.
To avoid this, it’s recommended to wrap the selector with `useShallow`, which prevents re-renders when the selected values remain shallowly equal.
This is more efficient than subscribing to the whole store. TypeScript ensures you can’t accidentally misspell `bears` or `food`.
See the [API documentation](../../reference/hooks/use-shallow.md) for more details on `useShallow`.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/react/shallow'

// Bear store with explicit types
interface BearState {
  bears: number
  food: number
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(() => ({
  bears: 2,
  food: 10,
}))

// In components, you can use both stores safely
function MultipleSelectors() {
  const { bears, food } = useBearStore(
    useShallow((state) => ({ bears: state.bears, food: state.food })),
  )

  return (
    <div>
      We have {food} units of food for {bears} bears
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Derived State with Selectors

Not all values need to be stored directly - some can be computed from existing state. You can derive values using selectors.
This avoids duplication and keeps the store minimal. TypeScript ensures `bears` is a number, so math is safe.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  foodPerBear: number
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(() => ({
  bears: 3,
  foodPerBear: 2,
}))

function TotalFood() {
  // Derived value: required amount food for all bears
  const totalFood = useBearStore((s) => s.bears * s.foodPerBear) // don't need to have extra property `{ totalFood: 6 }` in your Store

  return <div>We need ${totalFood} jars of honey</div>
}
```

### Middlewares

#### `combine` middleware

This middleware separates initial state and actions, making the code cleaner.
TS automatically infers types from the state and actions, no interface needed.
This is different from JS, where type safety is missing. It’s a very popular style in TypeScript projects.
See the [API documentation](../../reference/middlewares/combine.md) for more details.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: () => void
}

// State + actions are separated
export const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  combine({ bears: 0 }, (set) => ({
    increase: () => set((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + 1 })),
  })),
)
```

#### `devtools` middleware

This middleware connects Zustand to Redux DevTools. You can inspect changes, time-travel, and debug state.
It’s extremely useful in development. TS ensures your actions and state remain type-checked even here.
See the [API documentation](../../reference/middlewares/devtools.md) for more details.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: () => void
}

export const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  devtools((set) => ({
    bears: 0,
    increase: () => set((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + 1 })),
  })),
)
```

#### `persist` middleware

This middleware keeps your store in `localStorage` (or another storage). This means your bears survive a page refresh.
Great for apps where persistence matters. In TS, the state type stays consistent, so no runtime surprises.
See the [API documentation](../../reference/middlewares/persist.md) for more details.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: () => void
}

export const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      bears: 0,
      increase: () => set((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + 1 })),
    }),
    { name: 'bear-storage' }, // localStorage key
  ),
)
```

### Async Actions

Actions can be async to fetch remote data. Here we fetch bears count and update state.
TS enforces correct API response type (`BearData`). In JS you might misspell `count` - TS prevents that.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface BearData {
  count: number
}

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  fetchBears: () => Promise<void>
}

export const useBearStore = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  fetchBears: async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/bears')
    const data: BearData = await res.json()

    set({ bears: data.count })
  },
}))
```

### `createWithEqualityFn`

Variant of `create` with equality built-in. Useful if you always want custom equality checks.
Not common, but shows Zustand’s flexibility. TS still keeps full type inference.
See the [API documentation](../../reference/apis/create-with-equality-fn.md) for more details.

```ts
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useBearStore = createWithEqualityFn(() => ({
  bears: 0,
}))

const bears = useBearStore((s) => s.bears, Object.is)
// or
const bears = useBearStore((s) => ({ bears: s.bears }), shallow)
```

### Multiple Stores

You can create more than one store for different domains. For example, `BearStore` manages bears and `FishStore` manages fish.
This keeps state isolated and easier to maintain in larger apps. With TypeScript, each store has its own strict type - you can’t accidentally mix bears and fish.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

// Bear store with explicit types
interface BearState {
  bears: number
  addBear: () => void
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 2,
  addBear: () => set((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + 1 })),
}))

// Fish store with explicit types
interface FishState {
  fish: number
  addFish: () => void
}

const useFishStore = create<FishState>()((set) => ({
  fish: 5,
  addFish: () => set((s) => ({ fish: s.fish + 1 })),
}))

// In components, you can use both stores safely
function Zoo() {
  const { bears, addBear } = useBearStore()
  const { fish, addFish } = useFishStore()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {bears} bears and {fish} fish
      </div>
      <button onClick={addBear}>Add bear</button>
      <button onClick={addFish}>Add fish</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Conclusion

Zustand together with TypeScript provides a balance: you keep the simplicity of small, minimalistic stores, while gaining the safety of strong typing.
You don’t need boilerplate or complex patterns - state and actions live side by side, fully typed, and ready to use.
Start with a basic store to learn the pattern, then expand gradually: use `combine` for cleaner inference, `persist` for storage, and `devtools` for debugging.

## Basic usage

The difference when using TypeScript is that instead of writing `create(...)`, you have to write `create<T>()(...)` (notice the extra parentheses `()` too along with the type parameter) where `T` is the type of the state to annotate it. For example:

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
}))
```

<details>
  <summary>Why can't we simply infer the type from the initial state?</summary>

  <br/>

**TLDR**: Because state generic `T` is invariant.

Consider this minimal version `create`:

```ts
declare const create: <T>(f: (get: () => T) => T) => T

const x = create((get) => ({
  foo: 0,
  bar: () => get(),
}))
// `x` is inferred as `unknown` instead of
// interface X {
//   foo: number,
//   bar: () => X
// }
```

Here, if you look at the type of `f` in `create`, i.e. `(get: () => T) => T`, it "gives" `T` via return (making it covariant), but it also "takes" `T` via `get` (making it contravariant). "So where does `T` come from?" TypeScript wonders. It's like that chicken or egg problem. At the end TypeScript, gives up and infers `T` as `unknown`.

So, as long as the generic to be inferred is invariant (i.e. both covariant and contravariant), TypeScript will be unable to infer it. Another simple example would be this:

```ts
const createFoo = {} as <T>(f: (t: T) => T) => T
const x = createFoo((_) => 'hello')
```

Here again, `x` is `unknown` instead of `string`.

  <details>
    <summary>More about the inference (just for the people curious and interested in TypeScript)</summary>

In some sense this inference failure is not a problem because a value of type `<T>(f: (t: T) => T) => T` cannot be written. That is to say you can't write the real runtime implementation of `createFoo`. Let's try it:

```js
const createFoo = (f) => f(/* ? */)
```

`createFoo` needs to return the return value of `f`. And to do that we first have to call `f`. And to call it we have to pass a value of type `T`. And to pass a value of type `T` we first have to produce it. But how can we produce a value of type `T` when we don't even know what `T` is? The only way to produce a value of type `T` is to call `f`, but then to call `f` itself we need a value of type `T`. So you see it's impossible to actually write `createFoo`.

So what we're saying is, the inference failure in case of `createFoo` is not really a problem because it's impossible to implement `createFoo`. But what about the inference failure in case of `create`? That also is not really a problem because it's impossible to implement `create` too. Wait a minute, if it's impossible to implement `create` then how does Zustand implement it? The answer is, it doesn't.

Zustand lies that it implemented `create`'s type, it implemented only the most part of it. Here's a simple proof by showing unsoundness. Consider the following code:

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useBoundStore = create<{ foo: number }>()((_, get) => ({
  foo: get().foo,
}))
```

This code compiles. But if we run it, we'll get an exception: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'foo')". This is because `get` would return `undefined` before the initial state is created (hence you shouldn't call `get` when creating the initial state). The types promise that `get` will never return `undefined` but it does initially, which means Zustand failed to implement it.

And of course Zustand failed because it's impossible to implement `create` the way types promise (in the same way it's impossible to implement `createFoo`). In other words we don't have a type to express the actual `create` we have implemented. We can't type `get` as `() => T | undefined` because it would cause inconvenience and it still won't be correct as `get` is indeed `() => T` eventually, just if called synchronously it would be `() => undefined`. What we need is some kind of TypeScript feature that allows us to type `get` as `(() => T) & WhenSync<() => undefined>`, which of course is extremely far-fetched.

So we have two problems: lack of inference and unsoundness. Lack of inference can be solved if TypeScript can improve its inference for invariants. And unsoundness can be solved if TypeScript introduces something like `WhenSync`. To work around lack of inference we manually annotate the state type. And we can't work around unsoundness, but it's not a big deal because it's not much, calling `get` synchronously anyway doesn't make sense.

  <summary>Why the currying `()(...)`?</summary>

  <br/>

**TLDR**: It is a workaround for [microsoft/TypeScript#10571](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571).

Imagine you have a scenario like this:

```ts
declare const withError: <T, E>(
  p: Promise<T>,
) => Promise<[error: undefined, value: T] | [error: E, value: undefined]>
declare const doSomething: () => Promise<string>

const main = async () => {
  let [error, value] = await withError(doSomething())
}
```

Here, `T` is inferred to be a `string` and `E` is inferred to be `unknown`. You might want to annotate `E` as `Foo`, because you are certain of the shape of error `doSomething()` would throw. However, you can't do that. You can either pass all generics or none. Along with annotating `E` as `Foo`, you will also have to annotate `T` as `string` even though it gets inferred anyway. The solution is to make a curried version of `withError` that does nothing at runtime. Its purpose is to just allow you annotate `E`.

```ts
declare const withError: {
  <E>(): <T>(
    p: Promise<T>,
  ) => Promise<[error: undefined, value: T] | [error: E, value: undefined]>
  <T, E>(
    p: Promise<T>,
  ): Promise<[error: undefined, value: T] | [error: E, value: undefined]>
}
declare const doSomething: () => Promise<string>
interface Foo {
  bar: string
}

const main = async () => {
  let [error, value] = await withError<Foo>()(doSomething())
}
```

This way, `T` gets inferred and you get to annotate `E`. Zustand has the same use case when we want to annotate the state (the first type parameter) but allow other parameters to get inferred.

</details>

Alternatively, you can also use `combine`, which infers the state so that you do not need to type it.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useBearStore = create(
  combine({ bears: 0 }, (set) => ({
    increase: (by: number) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
  })),
)
```

<details>
  <summary>Be a little careful</summary>

  <br/>

We achieve the inference by lying a little in the types of `set`, `get`, and `store` that you receive as parameters. The lie is that they're typed as if the state is the first parameter, when in fact the state is the shallow-merge (`{ ...a, ...b }`) of both first parameter and the second parameter's return. For example, `get` from the second parameter has type `() => { bears: number }` and that is a lie as it should be `() => { bears: number, increase: (by: number) => void }`. And `useBearStore` still has the correct type; for example, `useBearStore.getState` is typed as `() => { bears: number, increase: (by: number) => void }`.

It isn't really a lie because `{ bears: number }` is still a subtype of `{ bears: number, increase: (by: number) => void }`. Therefore, there will be no problem in most cases. You should just be careful while using replace. For example, `set({ bears: 0 }, true)` would compile but will be unsound as it will delete the `increase` function. Another instance where you should be careful is if you use `Object.keys`. `Object.keys(get())` will return `["bears", "increase"]` and not `["bears"]`. The return type of `get` can make you fall for these mistakes.

`combine` trades off a little type-safety for the convenience of not having to write a type for state. Hence, you should use `combine` accordingly. It is fine in most cases and you can use it conveniently.

</details>

Note that we don't use the curried version when using `combine` because `combine` "creates" the state. When using a middleware that creates the state, it isn't necessary to use the curried version because the state now can be inferred. Another middleware that creates state is `redux`. So when using `combine`, `redux`, or any other custom middleware that creates the state, we don't recommend using the curried version.

If you want to infer state type also outside of state declaration, you can use the `ExtractState` type helper:

```ts
import { create, ExtractState } from 'zustand'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

type BearState = ExtractState<typeof useBearStore>

const useBearStore = create(
  combine({ bears: 0 }, (set) => ({
    increase: (by: number) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
  })),
)
```

## Using middlewares

You do not have to do anything special to use middlewares in TypeScript.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { devtools, persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  devtools(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        bears: 0,
        increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
      }),
      { name: 'bearStore' },
    ),
  ),
)
```

Just make sure you are using them immediately inside `create` so as to make the contextual inference work. Doing something even remotely fancy like the following `myMiddlewares` would require more advanced types.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { devtools, persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

const myMiddlewares = (f) => devtools(persist(f, { name: 'bearStore' }))

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  myMiddlewares((set) => ({
    bears: 0,
    increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
  })),
)
```

Also, we recommend using `devtools` middleware as last as possible. For example, when you use it with `immer` as a middleware, it should be `devtools(immer(...))` and not `immer(devtools(...))`. This is because`devtools` mutates the `setState` and adds a type parameter on it, which could get lost if other middlewares (like `immer`) also mutate `setState` before `devtools`. Hence using `devtools` at the end makes sure that no middlewares mutate `setState` before it.

## Authoring middlewares and advanced usage

Imagine you had to write this hypothetical middleware.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

const foo = (f, bar) => (set, get, store) => {
  store.foo = bar
  return f(set, get, store)
}

const useBearStore = create(foo(() => ({ bears: 0 }), 'hello'))
console.log(useBearStore.foo.toUpperCase())
```

Zustand middlewares can mutate the store. But how could we possibly encode the mutation on the type-level? That is to say how could we type `foo` so that this code compiles?

For a usual statically typed language, this is impossible. But thanks to TypeScript, Zustand has something called a "higher-kinded mutator" that makes this possible. If you are dealing with complex type problems, like typing a middleware or using the `StateCreator` type, you will have to understand this implementation detail. For this, you can [check out #710](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/issues/710).

If you are eager to know what the answer is to this particular problem then you can [see it here](#middleware-that-changes-the-store-type).

### Handling Dynamic `replace` Flag

If the value of the `replace` flag is not known at compile time and is determined dynamically, you might face issues. To handle this, you can use a workaround by annotating the `replace` parameter with the parameters of the `setState` function:

```ts
const replaceFlag = Math.random() > 0.5
const args = [{ bears: 5 }, replaceFlag] as Parameters<
  typeof useBearStore.setState
>
store.setState(...args)
```

#### Example with `as Parameters` Workaround

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
}))

const replaceFlag = Math.random() > 0.5
const args = [{ bears: 5 }, replaceFlag] as Parameters<
  typeof useBearStore.setState
>
useBearStore.setState(...args) // Using the workaround
```

By following this approach, you can ensure that your code handles dynamic `replace` flags without encountering type issues.

## Common recipes

### Middleware that doesn't change the store type

```ts
import { create, StateCreator, StoreMutatorIdentifier } from 'zustand'

type Logger = <
  T,
  Mps extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = [],
  Mcs extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = [],
>(
  f: StateCreator<T, Mps, Mcs>,
  name?: string,
) => StateCreator<T, Mps, Mcs>

type LoggerImpl = <T>(
  f: StateCreator<T, [], []>,
  name?: string,
) => StateCreator<T, [], []>

const loggerImpl: LoggerImpl = (f, name) => (set, get, store) => {
  const loggedSet: typeof set = (...a) => {
    set(...(a as Parameters<typeof set>))
    console.log(...(name ? [`${name}:`] : []), get())
  }
  const setState = store.setState
  store.setState = (...a) => {
    setState(...(a as Parameters<typeof setState>))
    console.log(...(name ? [`${name}:`] : []), store.getState())
  }

  return f(loggedSet, get, store)
}

export const logger = loggerImpl as unknown as Logger

// ---

const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  logger(
    (set) => ({
      bears: 0,
      increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
    }),
    'bear-store',
  ),
)
```

### Middleware that changes the store type

```ts
import {
  create,
  StateCreator,
  StoreMutatorIdentifier,
  Mutate,
  StoreApi,
} from 'zustand'

type Foo = <
  T,
  A,
  Mps extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = [],
  Mcs extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = [],
>(
  f: StateCreator<T, [...Mps, ['foo', A]], Mcs>,
  bar: A,
) => StateCreator<T, Mps, [['foo', A], ...Mcs]>

declare module 'zustand' {
  interface StoreMutators<S, A> {
    foo: Write<Cast<S, object>, { foo: A }>
  }
}

type FooImpl = <T, A>(
  f: StateCreator<T, [], []>,
  bar: A,
) => StateCreator<T, [], []>

const fooImpl: FooImpl = (f, bar) => (set, get, _store) => {
  type T = ReturnType<typeof f>
  type A = typeof bar

  const store = _store as Mutate<StoreApi<T>, [['foo', A]]>
  store.foo = bar
  return f(set, get, _store)
}

export const foo = fooImpl as unknown as Foo

type Write<T extends object, U extends object> = Omit<T, keyof U> & U

type Cast<T, U> = T extends U ? T : U

// ---

const useBearStore = create(foo(() => ({ bears: 0 }), 'hello'))
console.log(useBearStore.foo.toUpperCase())
```

### `create` without curried workaround

The recommended way to use `create` is using the curried workaround like so: `create<T>()(...)`. This is because it enables you to infer the store type. But if for some reason you do not want to use the workaround, you can pass the type parameters like the following. Note that in some cases, this acts as an assertion instead of annotation, so we don't recommend it.

```ts
import { create } from "zustand"

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const useBearStore = create<
  BearState,
  [
    ['zustand/persist', BearState],
    ['zustand/devtools', never]
  ]
>(devtools(persist((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
}), { name: 'bearStore' }))
```

### Slices pattern

```ts
import { create, StateCreator } from 'zustand'

interface BearSlice {
  bears: number
  addBear: () => void
  eatFish: () => void
}

interface FishSlice {
  fishes: number
  addFish: () => void
}

interface SharedSlice {
  addBoth: () => void
  getBoth: () => number
}

const createBearSlice: StateCreator<
  BearSlice & FishSlice,
  [],
  [],
  BearSlice
> = (set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addBear: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  eatFish: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes - 1 })),
})

const createFishSlice: StateCreator<
  BearSlice & FishSlice,
  [],
  [],
  FishSlice
> = (set) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  addFish: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 })),
})

const createSharedSlice: StateCreator<
  BearSlice & FishSlice,
  [],
  [],
  SharedSlice
> = (set, get) => ({
  addBoth: () => {
    // you can reuse previous methods
    get().addBear()
    get().addFish()
    // or do them from scratch
    // set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1, fishes: state.fishes + 1 })
  },
  getBoth: () => get().bears + get().fishes,
})

const useBoundStore = create<BearSlice & FishSlice & SharedSlice>()((...a) => ({
  ...createBearSlice(...a),
  ...createFishSlice(...a),
  ...createSharedSlice(...a),
}))
```

A detailed explanation on the slices pattern can be found [here](./slices-pattern.md).

If you have some middlewares then replace `StateCreator<MyState, [], [], MySlice>` with `StateCreator<MyState, Mutators, [], MySlice>`. For example, if you are using `devtools` then it will be `StateCreator<MyState, [["zustand/devtools", never]], [], MySlice>`. See the ["Middlewares and their mutators reference"](#middlewares-and-their-mutators-reference) section for a list of all mutators.

### Bounded `useStore` hook for vanilla stores

```ts
import { useStore } from 'zustand'
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const bearStore = createStore<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
}))

function useBearStore(): BearState
function useBearStore<T>(selector: (state: BearState) => T): T
function useBearStore<T>(selector?: (state: BearState) => T) {
  return useStore(bearStore, selector!)
}
```

You can also make an abstract `createBoundedUseStore` function if you need to create bounded `useStore` hooks often and want to DRY things up...

```ts
import { useStore, StoreApi } from 'zustand'
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
}

const bearStore = createStore<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
}))

const createBoundedUseStore = ((store) => (selector) =>
  useStore(store, selector)) as <S extends StoreApi<unknown>>(
  store: S,
) => {
  (): ExtractState<S>
  <T>(selector: (state: ExtractState<S>) => T): T
}

type ExtractState<S> = S extends { getState: () => infer X } ? X : never

const useBearStore = createBoundedUseStore(bearStore)
```

## Middlewares and their mutators reference

- `devtools` — `["zustand/devtools", never]`
- `persist` — `["zustand/persist", YourPersistedState]`<br/>
  `YourPersistedState` is the type of state you are going to persist, ie the return type of `options.partialize`, if you're not passing `partialize` options the `YourPersistedState` becomes `Partial<YourState>`. Also [sometimes](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/issues/980#issuecomment-1162289836) passing actual `PersistedState` won't work. In those cases, try passing `unknown`.
- `immer` — `["zustand/immer", never]`
- `subscribeWithSelector` — `["zustand/subscribeWithSelector", never]`
- `redux` — `["zustand/redux", YourAction]`
- `combine` — no mutator as `combine` does not mutate the store


<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/auto-generating-selectors.md -->

---
title: Auto Generating Selectors
nav: 14
---

We recommend using selectors when using either the properties or actions from the store. You can access values from the store like so:

```typescript
const bears = useBearStore((state) => state.bears)
```

However, writing these could be tedious. If that is the case for you, you can auto-generate your selectors.

## Create the following function: `createSelectors`

```typescript
import { StoreApi, UseBoundStore } from 'zustand'

type WithSelectors<S> = S extends { getState: () => infer T }
  ? S & { use: { [K in keyof T]: () => T[K] } }
  : never

const createSelectors = <S extends UseBoundStore<StoreApi<object>>>(
  _store: S,
) => {
  const store = _store as WithSelectors<typeof _store>
  store.use = {}
  for (const k of Object.keys(store.getState())) {
    ;(store.use as any)[k] = () => store((s) => s[k as keyof typeof s])
  }

  return store
}
```

If you have a store like this:

```typescript
interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
  increment: () => void
}

const useBearStoreBase = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
}))
```

Apply that function to your store:

```typescript
const useBearStore = createSelectors(useBearStoreBase)
```

Now the selectors are auto generated and you can access them directly:

```typescript
// get the property
const bears = useBearStore.use.bears()

// get the action
const increment = useBearStore.use.increment()
```

## Vanilla Store

If you are using a vanilla store, use the following `createSelectors` function:

```typescript
import { StoreApi, useStore } from 'zustand'

type WithSelectors<S> = S extends { getState: () => infer T }
  ? S & { use: { [K in keyof T]: () => T[K] } }
  : never

const createSelectors = <S extends StoreApi<object>>(_store: S) => {
  const store = _store as WithSelectors<typeof _store>
  store.use = {}
  for (const k of Object.keys(store.getState())) {
    ;(store.use as any)[k] = () =>
      useStore(_store, (s) => s[k as keyof typeof s])
  }

  return store
}
```

The usage is the same as a React store. If you have a store like this:

```typescript
import { createStore } from 'zustand'

interface BearState {
  bears: number
  increase: (by: number) => void
  increment: () => void
}

const store = createStore<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
}))
```

Apply that function to your store:

```typescript
const useBearStore = createSelectors(store)
```

Now the selectors are auto generated and you can access them directly:

```typescript
// get the property
const bears = useBearStore.use.bears()

// get the action
const increment = useBearStore.use.increment()
```

<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/nextjs.md -->

---
title: Setup with Next.js
nav: 15
---

> [!NOTE]
> We will be updating this guide soon based on our discussion in https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/discussions/2740.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a popular server-side rendering framework for React that presents
some unique challenges for using Zustand properly.
Keep in mind that Zustand store is a global
variable (AKA module state) making it optional to use a `Context`.
These challenges include:

- **Per-request store:** A Next.js server can handle multiple requests simultaneously. This means
  that the store should be created per request and should not be shared across requests.
- **SSR friendly:** Next.js applications are rendered twice, first on the server
  and again on the client. Having different outputs on both the client and the server will result
  in "hydration errors." The store will have to be initialized on the server and then
  re-initialized on the client with the same data in order to avoid that. Please read more about
  that in our [SSR and Hydration](./ssr-and-hydration.md) guide.
- **SPA routing friendly:** Next.js supports a hybrid model for client side routing, which means
  that in order to reset a store, we need to initialize it at the component level using a
  `Context`.
- **Server caching friendly:** Recent versions of Next.js (specifically applications using the App
  Router architecture) support aggressive server caching. Due to our store being a **module state**,
  it is completely compatible with this caching.

We have these general recommendations for the appropriate use of Zustand:

- **No global stores** - Because the store should not be shared across requests, it should not be defined
  as a global variable. Instead, the store should be created per request.
- **React Server Components should not read from or write to the store** - RSCs cannot use hooks or context. They aren't
  meant to be stateful. Having an RSC read from or write values to a global store violates the
  architecture of Next.js.

### Creating a store per request

Let's write our store factory function that will create a new store for each
request.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

> **Note:** do not forget to remove all comments from your `tsconfig.json` file.

### Initializing the store

```ts
// src/stores/counter-store.ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

export type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

export type CounterActions = {
  decrementCount: () => void
  incrementCount: () => void
}

export type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

export const defaultInitState: CounterState = {
  count: 0,
}

export const createCounterStore = (
  initState: CounterState = defaultInitState,
) => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    ...initState,
    decrementCount: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
    incrementCount: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  }))
}
```

### Providing the store

Let's use the `createCounterStore` in our component and share it using a context provider.

```tsx
// src/providers/counter-store-provider.tsx
'use client'

import { type ReactNode, createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react'
import { useStore } from 'zustand'

import { type CounterStore, createCounterStore } from '@/stores/counter-store'

export type CounterStoreApi = ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>

export const CounterStoreContext = createContext<CounterStoreApi | undefined>(
  undefined,
)

export interface CounterStoreProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

export const CounterStoreProvider = ({
  children,
}: CounterStoreProviderProps) => {
  const [store] = useState(() => createCounterStore())
  return (
    <CounterStoreContext.Provider value={store}>
      {children}
    </CounterStoreContext.Provider>
  )
}

export const useCounterStore = <T,>(
  selector: (store: CounterStore) => T,
): T => {
  const counterStoreContext = useContext(CounterStoreContext)
  if (!counterStoreContext) {
    throw new Error(`useCounterStore must be used within CounterStoreProvider`)
  }

  return useStore(counterStoreContext, selector)
}
```

> **Note:** In this example, we ensure that this component is re-render-safe by checking the
> value of the reference, so that the store is only created once. This component will only be
> rendered once per request on the server, but might be re-rendered multiple times on the client if
> there are stateful client components located above this component in the tree, or if this component
> also contains other mutable state that causes a re-render.

### Using the store with different architectures

There are two architectures for a Next.js application: the
[Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) and the
[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing). The usage of Zustand on
both architectures should be the same with slight differences related to each architecture.

#### Pages Router

```tsx
// src/components/pages/home-page.tsx
import { useCounterStore } from '@/providers/counter-store-provider'

export const HomePage = () => {
  const { count, incrementCount, decrementCount } = useCounterStore(
    (state) => state,
  )

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <hr />
      <button type="button" onClick={incrementCount}>
        Increment Count
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={decrementCount}>
        Decrement Count
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// src/_app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

import { CounterStoreProvider } from '@/providers/counter-store-provider'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <CounterStoreProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </CounterStoreProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// src/pages/index.tsx
import { HomePage } from '@/components/pages/home-page'

export default function Home() {
  return <HomePage />
}
```

> **Note:** creating a store per route would require creating and sharing the store
> at page (route) component level. Try not to use this if you do not need to create
> a store per route.

```tsx
// src/pages/index.tsx
import { CounterStoreProvider } from '@/providers/counter-store-provider'
import { HomePage } from '@/components/pages/home-page'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <CounterStoreProvider>
      <HomePage />
    </CounterStoreProvider>
  )
}
```

#### App Router

```tsx
// src/components/pages/home-page.tsx
'use client'

import { useCounterStore } from '@/providers/counter-store-provider'

export const HomePage = () => {
  const { count, incrementCount, decrementCount } = useCounterStore(
    (state) => state,
  )

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <hr />
      <button type="button" onClick={incrementCount}>
        Increment Count
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={decrementCount}>
        Decrement Count
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

import { CounterStoreProvider } from '@/providers/counter-store-provider'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <CounterStoreProvider>{children}</CounterStoreProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import { HomePage } from '@/components/pages/home-page'

export default function Home() {
  return <HomePage />
}
```

> **Note:** creating a store per route would require creating and sharing the store
> at page (route) component level. Try not to use this if you do not need to create
> a store per route.

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import { CounterStoreProvider } from '@/providers/counter-store-provider'
import { HomePage } from '@/components/pages/home-page'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <CounterStoreProvider>
      <HomePage />
    </CounterStoreProvider>
  )
}
```

## Server-side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side Rendering (SSR) is a technique that helps us render our components into
HTML strings on the server, send them directly to the browser, and finally "hydrate" the
static markup into a fully interactive app on the client.

### React

Let's say we want to render a stateless app using React. In order to do that, we need
to use `express`, `react` and `react-dom/server`. We don't need `react-dom/client`
since it's a stateless app.

Let's dive into that:

- `express` helps us build a web app that we can run using Node,
- `react` helps us build the UI components that we use in our app,
- `react-dom/server` helps us render our components on a server.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "esnext"
  },
  "include": ["**/*"]
}
```

> **Note:** do not forget to remove all comments from your `tsconfig.json` file.

```tsx
// app.tsx
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <title>Static Server-side-rendered App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div>Hello World!</div>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// server.tsx
import express from 'express'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'

import { App } from './app.tsx'

const port = Number.parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10)
const app = express()

app.get('/', (_, res) => {
  const { pipe } = ReactDOMServer.renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {
    onShellReady() {
      res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html')
      pipe(res)
    },
  })
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening at ${port}`)
})
```

```sh
tsc --build
```

```sh
node server.js
```

## Hydration

Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app
that runs in the browser. The right way to "hydrate" a component is by using `hydrateRoot`.

### React

Let's say we want to render a stateful app using React. In order to do that we need to
use `express`, `react`, `react-dom/server` and `react-dom/client`.

Let's dive into that:

- `express` helps us build a web app that we can run using Node,
- `react` helps us build the UI components that we use in our app,
- `react-dom/server` helps us render our components on a server,
- `react-dom/client` helps us hydrate our components on a client.

> **Note:** Do not forget that even if we can render our components on a server, it is
> important to "hydrate" them on a client to make them interactive.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "esnext"
  },
  "include": ["**/*"]
}
```

> **Note:** do not forget to remove all comments in your `tsconfig.json` file.

```tsx
// app.tsx
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <title>Static Server-side-rendered App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div>Hello World!</div>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// main.tsx
import ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client'

import { App } from './app.tsx'

ReactDOMClient.hydrateRoot(document, <App />)
```

```tsx
// server.tsx
import express from 'express'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'

import { App } from './app.tsx'

const port = Number.parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10)
const app = express()

app.use('/', (_, res) => {
  const { pipe } = ReactDOMServer.renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {
    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],
    onShellReady() {
      res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html')
      pipe(res)
    },
  })
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening at ${port}`)
})
```

```sh
tsc --build
```

```sh
node server.js
```

> **Warning:** The React tree you pass to `hydrateRoot` needs to produce the same output as it did on the server.
> The most common causes leading to hydration errors include:
>
> - Extra whitespace (like newlines) around the React-generated HTML inside the root node.
> - Using checks like typeof window !== 'undefined' in your rendering logic.
> - Using browser-only APIs like `window.matchMedia` in your rendering logic.
> - Rendering different data on the server and the client.
>
> React recovers from some hydration errors, but you must fix them like other bugs. In the best case, they’ll lead to a slowdown; in the worst case, event handlers can get attached to the wrong elements.

<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/initialize-state-with-props.md -->

---
title: Initialize state with props
nav: 17
---

In cases where [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is needed, such as when a store should be initialized with props from a component, the recommended approach is to use a vanilla store with React.context.

## Store creator with `createStore`

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand'

interface BearProps {
  bears: number
}

interface BearState extends BearProps {
  addBear: () => void
}

type BearStore = ReturnType<typeof createBearStore>

const createBearStore = (initProps?: Partial<BearProps>) => {
  const DEFAULT_PROPS: BearProps = {
    bears: 0,
  }
  return createStore<BearState>()((set) => ({
    ...DEFAULT_PROPS,
    ...initProps,
    addBear: () => set((state) => ({ bears: ++state.bears })),
  }))
}
```

## Creating a context with `React.createContext`

```ts
import { createContext } from 'react'

export const BearContext = createContext<BearStore | null>(null)
```

## Basic component usage

```tsx
// Provider implementation
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
  const [store] = useState(() => createBearStore())
  return (
    <BearContext.Provider value={store}>
      <BasicConsumer />
    </BearContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// Consumer component
import { useContext } from 'react'
import { useStore } from 'zustand'

function BasicConsumer() {
  const store = useContext(BearContext)
  if (!store) throw new Error('Missing BearContext.Provider in the tree')

  const bears = useStore(store, (s) => s.bears)
  const addBear = useStore(store, (s) => s.addBear)

  return (
    <>
      <div>{bears} Bears.</div>
      <button onClick={addBear}>Add bear</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Common patterns

### Wrapping the context provider

```tsx
// Provider wrapper
import { useState } from 'react'

type BearProviderProps = React.PropsWithChildren<BearProps>

function BearProvider({ children, ...props }: BearProviderProps) {
  const [store] = useState(() => createBearStore(props))
  return <BearContext.Provider value={store}>{children}</BearContext.Provider>
}
```

### Extracting context logic into a custom hook

```tsx
// Mimic the hook returned by `create`
import { useContext } from 'react'
import { useStore } from 'zustand'

function useBearContext<T>(selector: (state: BearState) => T): T {
  const store = useContext(BearContext)
  if (!store) throw new Error('Missing BearContext.Provider in the tree')
  return useStore(store, selector)
}
```

```tsx
// Consumer usage of the custom hook
function CommonConsumer() {
  const bears = useBearContext((s) => s.bears)
  const addBear = useBearContext((s) => s.addBear)
  return (
    <>
      <div>{bears} Bears.</div>
      <button onClick={addBear}>Add bear</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Optionally use memoized selector for stable outputs

```tsx
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/react/shallow'

const meals = ['Salmon', 'Berries', 'Nuts']

function CommonConsumer() {
  const bearMealsOrder = useBearContext(
    useShallow((s) =>
      Array.from({ length: s.bears }).map((_, index) =>
        meals.at(index % meals.length),
      ),
    ),
  )
  return (
    <>
      Order:
      <ul>
        {bearMealsOrder.map((meal) => (
          <li key={meal}>{meal}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Optionally allow using a custom equality function

```tsx
// Allow custom equality function by using useStoreWithEqualityFn instead of useStore
import { useContext } from 'react'
import { useStoreWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'

function useBearContext<T>(
  selector: (state: BearState) => T,
  equalityFn?: (left: T, right: T) => boolean,
): T {
  const store = useContext(BearContext)
  if (!store) throw new Error('Missing BearContext.Provider in the tree')
  return useStoreWithEqualityFn(store, selector, equalityFn)
}
```

### Complete example

```tsx
// Provider wrapper & custom hook consumer
function App2() {
  return (
    <BearProvider bears={2}>
      <HookConsumer />
    </BearProvider>
  )
}
```

## Setting Up a Test Environment

### Test Runners

Usually, your test runner needs to be configured to run JavaScript/TypeScript syntax. If you're
going to be testing UI components, you will likely need to configure the test runner to use JSDOM
to provide a mock DOM environment.

See these resources for test runner configuration instructions:

- **Jest**
  - [Jest: Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
  - [Jest: Configuration - Test Environment](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string)
- **Vitest**
  - [Vitest: Getting Started](https://vitest.dev/guide)
  - [Vitest: Configuration - Test Environment](https://vitest.dev/config/#environment)

### UI and Network Testing Tools

**We recommend using [React Testing Library (RTL)](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
to test out React components that connect to Zustand**. RTL is a simple and complete React DOM
testing utility that encourages good testing practices. It uses ReactDOM's `render` function and
`act` from `react-dom/tests-utils`. Furthermore, [Native Testing Library (RNTL)](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)
is the alternative to RTL to test out React Native components. The [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
family of tools also includes adapters for many other popular frameworks.

We also recommend using [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io/) to mock network requests, as
this means your application logic does not need to be changed or mocked when writing tests.

## Setting Up Zustand for testing

> **Note**: Since Jest and Vitest have slight differences, like Vitest using **ES modules** and Jest using
> **CommonJS modules**, you need to keep that in mind if you are using Vitest instead of Jest.

The mock provided below will enable the relevant test runner to reset the zustand stores after each test.

### Shared code just for testing purposes

This shared code was added to avoid code duplication in our demo since we use the same counter store
creator for both implementations, with and without `Context` API — `createStore` and `create`, respectively.

```ts
// shared/counter-store-creator.ts
import { type StateCreator } from 'zustand'

export type CounterStore = {
  count: number
  inc: () => void
}

export const counterStoreCreator: StateCreator<CounterStore> = (set) => ({
  count: 1,
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
})
```

### Jest

In the next steps we are going to setup our Jest environment in order to mock Zustand.

```ts
// __mocks__/zustand.ts
import { act } from '@testing-library/react'
import type * as ZustandExportedTypes from 'zustand'
export * from 'zustand'

const { create: actualCreate, createStore: actualCreateStore } =
  jest.requireActual<typeof ZustandExportedTypes>('zustand')

// a variable to hold reset functions for all stores declared in the app
export const storeResetFns = new Set<() => void>()

const createUncurried = <T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  const store = actualCreate(stateCreator)
  const initialState = store.getInitialState()
  storeResetFns.add(() => {
    store.setState(initialState, true)
  })
  return store
}

// when creating a store, we get its initial state, create a reset function and add it in the set
export const create = (<T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  console.log('zustand create mock')

  // to support curried version of create
  return typeof stateCreator === 'function'
    ? createUncurried(stateCreator)
    : createUncurried
}) as typeof ZustandExportedTypes.create

const createStoreUncurried = <T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  const store = actualCreateStore(stateCreator)
  const initialState = store.getInitialState()
  storeResetFns.add(() => {
    store.setState(initialState, true)
  })
  return store
}

// when creating a store, we get its initial state, create a reset function and add it in the set
export const createStore = (<T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  console.log('zustand createStore mock')

  // to support curried version of createStore
  return typeof stateCreator === 'function'
    ? createStoreUncurried(stateCreator)
    : createStoreUncurried
}) as typeof ZustandExportedTypes.createStore

// reset all stores after each test run
afterEach(() => {
  act(() => {
    storeResetFns.forEach((resetFn) => {
      resetFn()
    })
  })
})
```

```ts
// setup-jest.ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
```

```ts
// jest.config.ts
import type { JestConfigWithTsJest } from 'ts-jest'

const config: JestConfigWithTsJest = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./setup-jest.ts'],
}

export default config
```

> **Note**: to use TypeScript we need to install two packages `ts-jest` and `ts-node`.

### Vitest

In the next steps we are going to setup our Vitest environment in order to mock Zustand.

> **Warning:** In Vitest you can change the [root](https://vitest.dev/config/#root).
> Due to that, you need make sure that you are creating your `__mocks__` directory in the right place.
> Let's say that you change the **root** to `./src`, that means you need to create a `__mocks__`
> directory under `./src`. The end result would be `./src/__mocks__`, rather than `./__mocks__`.
> Creating `__mocks__` directory in the wrong place can lead to issues when using Vitest.

```ts
// __mocks__/zustand.ts
import { act } from '@testing-library/react'
import type * as ZustandExportedTypes from 'zustand'
export * from 'zustand'

const { create: actualCreate, createStore: actualCreateStore } =
  await vi.importActual<typeof ZustandExportedTypes>('zustand')

// a variable to hold reset functions for all stores declared in the app
export const storeResetFns = new Set<() => void>()

const createUncurried = <T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  const store = actualCreate(stateCreator)
  const initialState = store.getInitialState()
  storeResetFns.add(() => {
    store.setState(initialState, true)
  })
  return store
}

// when creating a store, we get its initial state, create a reset function and add it in the set
export const create = (<T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  console.log('zustand create mock')

  // to support curried version of create
  return typeof stateCreator === 'function'
    ? createUncurried(stateCreator)
    : createUncurried
}) as typeof ZustandExportedTypes.create

const createStoreUncurried = <T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  const store = actualCreateStore(stateCreator)
  const initialState = store.getInitialState()
  storeResetFns.add(() => {
    store.setState(initialState, true)
  })
  return store
}

// when creating a store, we get its initial state, create a reset function and add it in the set
export const createStore = (<T>(
  stateCreator: ZustandExportedTypes.StateCreator<T>,
) => {
  console.log('zustand createStore mock')

  // to support curried version of createStore
  return typeof stateCreator === 'function'
    ? createStoreUncurried(stateCreator)
    : createStoreUncurried
}) as typeof ZustandExportedTypes.createStore

// reset all stores after each test run
afterEach(() => {
  act(() => {
    storeResetFns.forEach((resetFn) => {
      resetFn()
    })
  })
})
```

> **Note**: without [globals configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#globals) enabled, we need
> to add `import { afterEach, vi } from 'vitest'` at the top.

```ts
// global.d.ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
/// <reference types="vitest/globals" />
```

> **Note**: without [globals configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#globals) enabled, we do
> need to remove `/// <reference types="vitest/globals" />`.

```ts
// setup-vitest.ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest'

vi.mock('zustand') // to make it work like Jest (auto-mocking)
```

> **Note**: without [globals configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#globals) enabled, we need
> to add `import { vi } from 'vitest'` at the top.

```ts
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig, mergeConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import viteConfig from './vite.config'

export default defineConfig((configEnv) =>
  mergeConfig(
    viteConfig(configEnv),
    defineConfig({
      test: {
        globals: true,
        environment: 'jsdom',
        setupFiles: ['./setup-vitest.ts'],
      },
    }),
  ),
)
```

### Testing Components

In the next examples we are going to use `useCounterStore`

> **Note**: all of these examples are written using TypeScript.

```ts
// shared/counter-store-creator.ts
import { type StateCreator } from 'zustand'

export type CounterStore = {
  count: number
  inc: () => void
}

export const counterStoreCreator: StateCreator<CounterStore> = (set) => ({
  count: 1,
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
})
```

```ts
// stores/use-counter-store.ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

import {
  type CounterStore,
  counterStoreCreator,
} from '../shared/counter-store-creator'

export const useCounterStore = create<CounterStore>()(counterStoreCreator)
```

```tsx
// contexts/use-counter-store-context.tsx
import { type ReactNode, createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'
import { createStore } from 'zustand'
import { useStoreWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

import {
  type CounterStore,
  counterStoreCreator,
} from '../shared/counter-store-creator'

export const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>(counterStoreCreator)
}

export type CounterStoreApi = ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>

export const CounterStoreContext = createContext<CounterStoreApi | undefined>(
  undefined,
)

export interface CounterStoreProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

export const CounterStoreProvider = ({

  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
})
```

title: Flux inspired practice
nav: 19
---

Although Zustand is an unopinionated library, we do recommend a few patterns.
These are inspired by practices originally found in [Flux](https://github.com/facebookarchive/flux),
and more recently [Redux](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles),
so if you are coming from another library, you should feel right at home.

However, Zustand does differ in some fundamental ways,
so some terminology may not perfectly align to other libraries.

## Recommended patterns

### Single store

Your applications global state should be located in a single Zustand store.

If you have a large application, Zustand supports [splitting the store into slices](./slices-pattern.md).

### Use `set` / `setState` to update the store

Always use `set` (or `setState`) to perform updates to your store.
`set` (and `setState`) ensures the described update is correctly merged and listeners are appropriately notified.

### Colocate store actions

In Zustand, state can be updated without the use of dispatched actions and reducers found in other Flux libraries.
These store actions can be added directly to the store as shown below.

Optionally, by using `setState` they can be [located external to the store](./practice-with-no-store-actions.md)

```js
const useBoundStore = create((set) => ({
  storeSliceA: ...,
  storeSliceB: ...,
  storeSliceC: ...,
  updateX: () => set(...),
  updateY: () => set(...),
}))
```

## Redux-like patterns

If you can't live without Redux-like reducers, you can define a `dispatch` function on the root level of the store:

```typescript
const types = { increase: 'INCREASE', decrease: 'DECREASE' }

const reducer = (state, { type, by = 1 }) => {
  switch (type) {
    case types.increase:
      return { grumpiness: state.grumpiness + by }
    case types.decrease:
      return { grumpiness: state.grumpiness - by }
  }
}

const useGrumpyStore = create((set) => ({
  grumpiness: 0,
  dispatch: (args) => set((state) => reducer(state, args)),
}))

const dispatch = useGrumpyStore((state) => state.dispatch)
dispatch({ type: types.increase, by: 2 })
```

You could also use our redux-middleware. It wires up your main reducer, sets initial state, and adds a dispatch function to the state itself and the vanilla api.

```typescript
import { redux } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useReduxStore = create(redux(reducer, initialState))
```

Another way to update the store could be through functions wrapping the state functions. These could also handle side-effects of actions. For example, with HTTP-calls. To use Zustand in a non-reactive way, see [the readme](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#readingwriting-state-and-reacting-to-changes-outside-of-components).


<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/learn/guides/how-to-reset-state.md -->

---
title: How to reset state
nav: 20
---

The following pattern can be used to reset the state to its initial value.

```ts
const useSomeStore = create<State & Actions>()((set, get, store) => ({
  // your code here
  reset: () => {
    set(store.getInitialState())
  },
}))
```

Resetting multiple stores at once

```ts
import type { StateCreator } from 'zustand'
import { create: actualCreate } from 'zustand'

const storeResetFns = new Set<() => void>()

const resetAllStores = () => {
  storeResetFns.forEach((resetFn) => {
    resetFn()
  })
}

export const create = (<T>() => {
  return (stateCreator: StateCreator<T>) => {
    const store = actualCreate(stateCreator)
    storeResetFns.add(() => {
      store.setState(store.getInitialState(), true)
    })
    return store
  }
}) as typeof actualCreate
```

- [`createStore`](./apis/create-store.md) — Create a standalone store without React.
- [`createWithEqualityFn`](./apis/create-with-equality-fn.md) — Like `create`, but with a custom equality function.
- [`shallow`](./apis/shallow.md) — Utility for shallow comparison of objects and arrays.

## Hooks

React hooks for reading and subscribing to store state.

- [`useStore`](./hooks/use-store.md) — Access and subscribe to a vanilla store from a React component.
- [`useStoreWithEqualityFn`](./hooks/use-store-with-equality-fn.md) — Like `useStore`, but with a custom equality function.
- [`useShallow`](./hooks/use-shallow.md) — Derive a stable reference from a selector using shallow comparison.

## Middlewares

Composable middleware functions for extending store behavior.

- [`persist`](./middlewares/persist.md) — Persist and rehydrate state using `localStorage` or a custom storage engine.
- [`devtools`](./middlewares/devtools.md) — Connect a store to Redux DevTools for time-travel debugging.
- [`redux`](./middlewares/redux.md) — Use a reducer and dispatch pattern similar to Redux.

## Types

### Signature

```ts
create<T>()(stateCreatorFn: StateCreator<T, [], []>): UseBoundStore<StoreApi<T>>
```

## Reference

### `create(stateCreatorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.

#### Returns

`create` returns a React Hook with API utilities, `setState`, `getState`, `getInitialState` and
`subscribe`, attached. It lets you return data that is based on current state, using a selector
function. It should take a selector function as its only argument.

## Usage

### Updating state based on previous state

To update a state based on previous state we should use **updater functions**. Read more
about that [here](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates).

This example shows how you can support **updater functions** within **actions**.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type AgeStoreState = { age: number }

type AgeStoreActions = {
  setAge: (
    nextAge:
      | AgeStoreState['age']
      | ((currentAge: AgeStoreState['age']) => AgeStoreState['age']),
  ) => void
}

type AgeStore = AgeStoreState & AgeStoreActions

const useAgeStore = create<AgeStore>()((set) => ({
  age: 42,
  setAge: (nextAge) => {
    set((state) => ({
      age: typeof nextAge === 'function' ? nextAge(state.age) : nextAge,
    }))
  },
}))

export default function App() {
  const age = useAgeStore((state) => state.age)
  const setAge = useAgeStore((state) => state.setAge)

  function increment() {
    setAge((currentAge) => currentAge + 1)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          increment()
          increment()
          increment()
        }}
      >
        +3
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          increment()
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Updating Primitives in State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value. When you want to update built-in primitive values like
numbers, strings, booleans, etc. you should directly assign new values to ensure updates are applied
correctly, and avoid unexpected behaviors.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. If you need to completely replace the state
> with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true`

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type XStore = number

const useXStore = create<XStore>()(() => 0)

export default function MovingDot() {
  const x = useXStore()
  const setX = (nextX: number) => {
    useXStore.setState(nextX, true)
  }
  const position = { y: 0, x }

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setX(e.clientX)
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Updating Objects in State

Objects are **mutable** in JavaScript, but you should treat them as **immutable** when you store
them in state. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a
copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use the new object.

By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. For most updates where you only need to modify
specific properties, the default shallow merge is preferred as it's more efficient. To completely
replace the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true` with caution, as it
discards any existing nested data within the state.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const usePositionStore = create<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (nextPosition) => set({ position: nextPosition }),
}))

export default function MovingDot() {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Updating Arrays in State

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in
state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create
a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.

By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. To update array values we should assign new
values to ensure updates are applied correctly, and avoid unexpected behaviors. To completely
replace the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should prefer immutable operations like: `[...array]`, `concat(...)`, `filter(...)`,
> `slice(...)`, `map(...)`, `toSpliced(...)`, `toSorted(...)`, and `toReversed(...)`, and avoid
> mutable operations like `array[arrayIndex] = ...`, `push(...)`, `unshift(...)`, `pop(...)`,
> `shift(...)`, `splice(...)`, `reverse(...)`, and `sort(...)`.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type PositionStore = [number, number]

const usePositionStore = create<PositionStore>()(() => [0, 0])

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [x, y] = usePositionStore()
  const setPosition: typeof usePositionStore.setState = (nextPosition) => {
    usePositionStore.setState(nextPosition, true)
  }
  const position = { x, y }

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition([e.clientX, e.clientY])
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

### Updating state with no store actions

Defining actions at module level, external to the store have a few advantages like: it doesn't
require a hook to call an action, and it facilitates code splitting.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way is to colocate actions and states within the store (let your actions be
> located together with your state).

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

const usePositionStore = create<{
  x: number
  y: number
}>()(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }))

const setPosition: typeof usePositionStore.setState = (nextPosition) => {
  usePositionStore.setState(nextPosition)
}

export default function MovingDot() {
  const position = usePositionStore()

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
        onMouseEnter={(event) => {
          const parent = event.currentTarget.parentElement
          const parentWidth = parent.clientWidth
          const parentHeight = parent.clientHeight

          setPosition({
            x: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentWidth),
            y: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentHeight),
          })
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Subscribing to state updates

By subscribing to state updates, you register a callback that fires whenever the store's state
updates. We can use `subscribe` for external state management.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { create } from 'zustand'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const usePositionStore = create<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (nextPosition) => set({ position: nextPosition }),
}))

export default function MovingDot() {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribePositionStore = usePositionStore.subscribe(
      ({ position }) => {
        console.log('new position', { position })
      },
    )

    return () => {
      unsubscribePositionStore()
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
        onMouseEnter={(event) => {
          const parent = event.currentTarget.parentElement
          const parentWidth = parent.clientWidth
          const parentHeight = parent.clientHeight

          setPosition({
            x: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentWidth),
            y: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentHeight),
          })
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update

In the previous example, the `position` object is always created fresh from the current cursor
position. But often, you will want to include existing data as a part of the new object you’re
creating. For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous
values for all other fields.

These input fields don’t work because the `onChange` handlers mutate the state:

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type PersonStoreState = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (nextPerson: Partial<PersonStoreState>) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const usePersonStore = create<PersonStore>()((set) => ({
  firstName: 'Barbara',
  lastName: 'Hepworth',
  email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  setPerson: (nextPerson) => set(nextPerson),
}))

export default function Form() {
  const person = usePersonStore((state) => state)
  const setPerson = usePersonStore((state) => state.setPerson)

  function handleFirstNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    person.firstName = e.target.value
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    person.lastName = e.target.value
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    person.email = e.target.value
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        First name:
        <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Last name:
        <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Email:
        <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```

For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:

```tsx
person.firstName = e.target.value
```

The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to
`setPerson`. But here you want to also copy the existing data into it because only one of the
fields has changed:

```ts
setPerson({ ...person, firstName: e.target.value }) // New first name from the input
```

> [!NOTE]
> We don’t need to copy every property separately due to `set` function performing shallow merge by
> default.

Now the form works!

Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms,
keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly!

```tsx {27,31,35}
import { create } from 'zustand'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (nextPerson: PersonStoreState['person']) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const usePersonStore = create<PersonStore>()((set) => ({
  person: {
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  },
  setPerson: (nextPerson) => set(nextPerson),
}))

export default function Form() {
  const person = usePersonStore((state) => state.person)
  const setPerson = usePersonStore((state) => state.setPerson)

  function handleFirstNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setPerson({ ...person, firstName: e.target.value })
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setPerson({ ...person, lastName: e.target.value })
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setPerson({ ...person, email: e.target.value })
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        First name:
        <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Last name:
        <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Email:
        <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Types

### Signature

```ts
createStore<T>()(stateCreatorFn: StateCreator<T, [], []>): StoreApi<T>
```

## Reference

### `createStore(stateCreatorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.

#### Returns

`createStore` returns a vanilla store that exposes API utilities, `setState`, `getState`,
`getInitialState` and `subscribe`.

## Usage

### Updating state based on previous state

This example shows how you can support **updater functions** within **actions**.

```tsx
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type AgeStoreState = { age: number }

type AgeStoreActions = {
  setAge: (
    nextAge:
      | AgeStoreState['age']
      | ((currentAge: AgeStoreState['age']) => AgeStoreState['age']),
  ) => void
}

type AgeStore = AgeStoreState & AgeStoreActions

const ageStore = createStore<AgeStore>()((set) => ({
  age: 42,
  setAge: (nextAge) =>
    set((state) => ({
      age: typeof nextAge === 'function' ? nextAge(state.age) : nextAge,
    })),
}))

function increment() {
  ageStore.getState().setAge((currentAge) => currentAge + 1)
}

const $yourAgeHeading = document.getElementById(
  'your-age',
) as HTMLHeadingElement
const $incrementBy3Button = document.getElementById(
  'increment-by-3',
) as HTMLButtonElement
const $incrementBy1Button = document.getElementById(
  'increment-by-1',
) as HTMLButtonElement

$incrementBy3Button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  increment()
  increment()
  increment()
})

$incrementBy1Button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  increment()
})

const render: Parameters<typeof ageStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $yourAgeHeading.innerHTML = `Your age: ${state.age}`
}

render(ageStore.getInitialState(), ageStore.getInitialState())

ageStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<h1 id="your-age"></h1>
<button id="increment-by-3" type="button">+3</button>
<button id="increment-by-1" type="button">+1</button>
```

### Updating Primitives in State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value. When you want to update built-in primitive values like
numbers, strings, booleans, etc. you should directly assign new values to ensure updates are applied
correctly, and avoid unexpected behaviors.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. If you need to completely replace
> the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true`

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type XStore = number

const xStore = createStore<XStore>()(() => 0)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  xStore.setState(event.clientX, true)
})

const render: Parameters<typeof xStore.subscribe>[0] = (x) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${x}px, 0)`
}

render(xStore.getInitialState(), xStore.getInitialState())

xStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Updating Objects in State

Objects are **mutable** in JavaScript, but you should treat them as **immutable** when you store
them in state. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a
copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use the new object.

By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. For most updates where you only need to modify
specific properties, the default shallow merge is preferred as it's more efficient. To completely
replace the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true` with caution, as it
discards any existing nested data within the state.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
}))

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getInitialState(), positionStore.getInitialState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Updating Arrays in State

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in
state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create
a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.

By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. To update array values we should assign new
values to ensure updates are applied correctly, and avoid unexpected behaviors. To completely
replace the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should prefer immutable operations like: `[...array]`, `concat(...)`, `filter(...)`,
> `slice(...)`, `map(...)`, `toSpliced(...)`, `toSorted(...)`, and `toReversed(...)`, and avoid
> mutable operations like `array[arrayIndex] = ...`, `push(...)`, `unshift(...)`, `pop(...)`,
> `shift(...)`, `splice(...)`, `reverse(...)`, and `sort(...)`.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type PositionStore = [number, number]

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(() => [0, 0])

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.setState([event.clientX, event.clientY], true)
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = ([x, y]) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getInitialState(), positionStore.getInitialState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Subscribing to state updates

By subscribing to state updates, you register a callback that fires whenever the store's state
updates. We can use `subscribe` for external state management.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
}))

const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dot.addEventListener('mouseenter', (event) => {
  const parent = event.currentTarget.parentElement
  const parentWidth = parent.clientWidth
  const parentHeight = parent.clientHeight

  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentWidth),
    y: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentHeight),
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getInitialState(), positionStore.getInitialState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)

const logger: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  console.log('new position', { position: state.position })
}

positionStore.subscribe(logger)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

### I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update

In the previous example, the `position` object is always created fresh from the current cursor
position. But often, you will want to include existing data as a part of the new object you’re
creating. For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous
values for all other fields.

These input fields don’t work because the `oninput` handlers mutate the state:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (nextPerson: PersonStoreState['person']) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const personStore = createStore<PersonStore>()((set) => ({
  person: {
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  },
  setPerson: (person) => set({ person }),
}))

const $firstNameInput = document.getElementById(
  'first-name',
) as HTMLInputElement
const $lastNameInput = document.getElementById('last-name') as HTMLInputElement
const $emailInput = document.getElementById('email') as HTMLInputElement
const $result = document.getElementById('result') as HTMLDivElement

function handleFirstNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().person.firstName = (event.target as any).value
}

function handleLastNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().person.lastName = (event.target as any).value
}

function handleEmailChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().person.email = (event.target as any).value
}

$firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleFirstNameChange)
$lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleLastNameChange)
$emailInput.addEventListener('input', handleEmailChange)

const render: Parameters<typeof personStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $firstNameInput.value = state.person.firstName
  $lastNameInput.value = state.person.lastName
  $emailInput.value = state.person.email

  $result.innerHTML = `${state.person.firstName} ${state.person.lastName} (${state.person.email})`
}

render(personStore.getInitialState(), personStore.getInitialState())

personStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<label style="display: block">
  First name:
  <input id="first-name" />
</label>
<label style="display: block">
  Last name:
  <input id="last-name" />
</label>
<label style="display: block">
  Email:
  <input id="email" />
</label>
<p id="result"></p>
```

For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:

```ts
personStore.getState().firstName = (e.target as any).value
```

The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to
`setPerson`. But here you want to also copy the existing data into it because only one of the
fields has changed:

```ts
personStore.getState().setPerson({
  firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> We don’t need to copy every property separately due to `set` function performing shallow merge by
> default.

Now the form works!

Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms,
keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly!

```ts {32-34,38-40,44-46}
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (nextPerson: PersonStoreState['person']) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const personStore = createStore<PersonStore>()((set) => ({
  person: {
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  },
  setPerson: (person) => set({ person }),
}))

const $firstNameInput = document.getElementById(
  'first-name',
) as HTMLInputElement
const $lastNameInput = document.getElementById('last-name') as HTMLInputElement
const $emailInput = document.getElementById('email') as HTMLInputElement
const $result = document.getElementById('result') as HTMLDivElement

function handleFirstNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson({
    ...personStore.getState().person,
    firstName: (event.target as any).value,
  })
}

function handleLastNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson({
    ...personStore.getState().person,
    lastName: (event.target as any).value,
  })
}

function handleEmailChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson({
    ...personStore.getState().person,
    email: (event.target as any).value,
  })
}

$firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleFirstNameChange)
$lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleLastNameChange)
$emailInput.addEventListener('input', handleEmailChange)

const render: Parameters<typeof personStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $firstNameInput.value = state.person.firstName
  $lastNameInput.value = state.person.lastName
  $emailInput.value = state.person.email

  $result.innerHTML = `${state.person.firstName} ${state.person.lastName} (${state.person.email})`
}

render(personStore.getInitialState(), personStore.getInitialState())

personStore.subscribe(render)
```

`createWithEqualityFn` lets you create a React Hook with API utilities attached, just like `create`.
However, it offers a way to define a custom equality check. This allows for more granular control
over when components re-render, improving performance and responsiveness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to use `createWithEqualityFn` from `zustand/traditional` you need to install
> `use-sync-external-store` library due to `zustand/traditional` relies on `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector`.

```js
const useSomeStore = createWithEqualityFn(stateCreatorFn, equalityFn)

## Types

### Signature

```ts
createWithEqualityFn<T>()(stateCreatorFn: StateCreator<T, [], []>, equalityFn?: (a: T, b: T) => boolean): UseBoundStore<StoreApi<T>>
```

## Reference

### `createWithEqualityFn(stateCreatorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.
- **optional** `equalityFn`: Defaults to `Object.is`. A function that lets you skip re-renders.

#### Returns

`createWithEqualityFn` returns a React Hook with API utilities attached, just like `create`. It
lets you return data that is based on current state, using a selector function, and lets you skip
re-renders using an equality function. It should take a selector function, and an equality function
as arguments.

## Usage

### Updating state based on previous state

To update a state based on previous state we should use **updater functions**. Read more
about that [here](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates).

This example shows how you can support **updater functions** within **actions**.

```tsx
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type AgeStoreState = { age: number }

type AgeStoreActions = {
  setAge: (
    nextAge:
      | AgeStoreState['age']
      | ((currentAge: AgeStoreState['age']) => AgeStoreState['age']),
  ) => void
}

type AgeStore = AgeStoreState & AgeStoreActions

const useAgeStore = createWithEqualityFn<AgeStore>()(
  (set) => ({
    age: 42,
    setAge: (nextAge) =>
      set((state) => ({
        age: typeof nextAge === 'function' ? nextAge(state.age) : nextAge,
      })),
  }),
  shallow,
)

export default function App() {
  const age = useAgeStore((state) => state.age)
  const setAge = useAgeStore((state) => state.setAge)

  function increment() {
    setAge((currentAge) => currentAge + 1)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          increment()
          increment()
          increment()
        }}
      >
        +3
      </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          increment()
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Updating Primitives in State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value. When you want to update built-in primitive values like
numbers, strings, booleans, etc. you should directly assign new values to ensure updates are applied
correctly, and avoid unexpected behaviors.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. If you need to completely replace
> the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true`

```tsx
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type XStore = number

const useXStore = createWithEqualityFn<XStore>()(() => 0, shallow)

export default function MovingDot() {
  const x = useXStore()
  const setX = (nextX: number) => {
    useXStore.setState(nextX, true)
  }
  const position = { y: 0, x }

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setX(e.clientX)
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Updating Objects in State

Objects are **mutable** in JavaScript, but you should treat them as **immutable** when you store
them in state. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a
copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use the new object.

By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. For most updates where you only need to modify
specific properties, the default shallow merge is preferred as it's more efficient. To completely
replace the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true` with caution, as it
discards any existing nested data within the state.

```tsx
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const usePositionStore = createWithEqualityFn<PositionStore>()(
  (set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  }),
  shallow,
)

export default function MovingDot() {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Updating Arrays in State

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in
state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create
a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.

By default, `set` function performs a shallow merge. To update array values we should assign new
values to ensure updates are applied correctly, and avoid unexpected behaviors. To completely
replace the state with a new one, use the `replace` parameter set to `true`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should prefer immutable operations like: `[...array]`, `concat(...)`, `filter(...)`,
> `slice(...)`, `map(...)`, `toSpliced(...)`, `toSorted(...)`, and `toReversed(...)`, and avoid
> mutable operations like `array[arrayIndex] = ...`, `push(...)`, `unshift(...)`, `pop(...)`,
> `shift(...)`, `splice(...)`, `reverse(...)`, and `sort(...)`.

```tsx
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type PositionStore = [number, number]

const usePositionStore = createWithEqualityFn<PositionStore>()(
  () => [0, 0],
  shallow,
)

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [x, y] = usePositionStore()
  const position = { x, y }
  const setPosition: typeof usePositionStore.setState = (nextPosition) => {
    usePositionStore.setState(nextPosition, true)
  }

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition([e.clientX, e.clientY])
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Updating state with no store actions

Defining actions at module level, external to the store have a few advantages like: it doesn't
require a hook to call an action, and it facilitates code splitting.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way is to colocate actions and states within the store (let your actions be
> located together with your state).

```tsx
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

const usePositionStore = createWithEqualityFn<{
  x: number
  y: number
}>()(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }), shallow)

const setPosition: typeof usePositionStore.setState = (nextPosition) => {
  usePositionStore.setState(nextPosition)
}

export default function MovingDot() {
  const position = usePositionStore()

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
        onMouseEnter={(event) => {
          const parent = event.currentTarget.parentElement
          const parentWidth = parent.clientWidth
          const parentHeight = parent.clientHeight

          setPosition({
            x: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentWidth),
            y: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentHeight),
          })
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Subscribing to state updates

By subscribing to state updates, you register a callback that fires whenever the store's state
updates. We can use `subscribe` for external state management.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const usePositionStore = createWithEqualityFn<PositionStore>()(
  (set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (nextPosition) => set({ position: nextPosition }),
  }),
  shallow,
)

export default function MovingDot() {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribePositionStore = usePositionStore.subscribe(
      ({ position }) => {
        console.log('new position', { position })
      },
    )

    return () => {
      unsubscribePositionStore()
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
        onMouseEnter={(event) => {
          const parent = event.currentTarget.parentElement
          const parentWidth = parent.clientWidth
          const parentHeight = parent.clientHeight

          setPosition({
            x: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentWidth),
            y: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentHeight),
          })
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update

In the previous example, the `position` object is always created fresh from the current cursor
position. But often, you will want to include existing data as a part of the new object you’re
creating. For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous
values for all other fields.

These input fields don’t work because the `onChange` handlers mutate the state:

```tsx
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (nextPerson: PersonStoreState['person']) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const usePersonStore = createWithEqualityFn<PersonStore>()(
  (set) => ({
    person: {
      firstName: 'Barbara',
      lastName: 'Hepworth',
      email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
    },
    setPerson: (person) => set({ person }),
  }),
  shallow,
)

export default function Form() {
  const person = usePersonStore((state) => state.person)
  const setPerson = usePersonStore((state) => state.setPerson)

  function handleFirstNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    person.firstName = e.target.value
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    person.lastName = e.target.value
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    person.email = e.target.value
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        First name:
        <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Last name:
        <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Email:
        <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```

For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:

```tsx
person.firstName = e.target.value
```

The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to
`setPerson`. But here you want to also copy the existing data into it because only one of the
fields has changed:

```ts
setPerson({ ...person, firstName: e.target.value }) // New first name from the input
```

> [!NOTE]
> We don’t need to copy every property separately due to `set` function performing shallow merge by
> default.

Now the form works!

Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms,
keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly!

```tsx {32,36,40}
import { type ChangeEvent } from 'react'
import { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/vanilla/shallow'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (nextPerson: PersonStoreState['person']) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const usePersonStore = createWithEqualityFn<PersonStore>()(
  (set) => ({
    person: {
      firstName: 'Barbara',
      lastName: 'Hepworth',
      email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
    },
    setPerson: (nextPerson) => set({ person: nextPerson }),
  }),
  shallow,
)

export default function Form() {
  const person = usePersonStore((state) => state.person)
  const setPerson = usePersonStore((state) => state.setPerson)

  function handleFirstNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setPerson({ ...person, firstName: e.target.value })
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setPerson({ ...person, lastName: e.target.value })
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setPerson({ ...person, email: e.target.value })
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        First name:
        <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Last name:
        <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label style={{ display: 'block' }}>
        Email:
        <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```

description: How compare simple data effectively

`shallow` lets you run fast checks on simple data structures. It effectively identifies changes in
**top-level** properties when you're working with data structures that don't have nested objects or
arrays within them.

> [!NOTE]
> Shallow lets you perform quick comparisons, but keep its limitations in mind.

```js
const equal = shallow(a, b)
```

  - [Comparing objects with different prototypes](#comparing-objects-with-different-prototypes)

## Types

### Signature

```ts
shallow<T>(a: T, b: T): boolean
```

## Reference

### `shallow(a, b)`

#### Parameters

- `a`: The first value.
- `b`: The second value.

#### Returns

`shallow` returns `true` when `a` and `b` are equal based on a shallow comparison of their
**top-level** properties. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

## Usage

### Comparing Primitives

When comparing primitive values like `string`s, `number`s, `boolean`s, and `BigInt`s, both
`Object.is` and `shallow` function return `true` if the values are the same. This is because
primitive values are compared by their actual value rather than by reference.

```ts
const stringLeft = 'John Doe'
const stringRight = 'John Doe'

Object.is(stringLeft, stringRight) // -> true
shallow(stringLeft, stringRight) // -> true

const numberLeft = 10
const numberRight = 10

Object.is(numberLeft, numberRight) // -> true
shallow(numberLeft, numberRight) // -> true

const booleanLeft = true
const booleanRight = true

Object.is(booleanLeft, booleanRight) // -> true
shallow(booleanLeft, booleanRight) // -> true

const bigIntLeft = 1n
const bigIntRight = 1n

Object.is(bigIntLeft, bigIntRight) // -> true
shallow(bigIntLeft, bigIntRight) // -> true
```

### Comparing Objects

When comparing objects, it's important to understand how `Object.is` and `shallow` function
operate, as they handle comparisons differently.

The `shallow` function returns `true` because shallow performs a shallow comparison of the objects.
It checks if the top-level properties and their values are the same. In this case, the top-level
properties (`firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`) and their values are identical between `objectLeft`
and `objectRight`, so shallow considers them equal.

```ts
const objectLeft = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
}
const objectRight = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
}

Object.is(objectLeft, objectRight) // -> false
shallow(objectLeft, objectRight) // -> true
```

### Comparing Sets

When comparing sets, it's important to understand how `Object.is` and `shallow` function operate,
as they handle comparisons differently.

The `shallow` function returns `true` because shallow performs a shallow comparison of the sets. It
checks if the top-level properties (in this case, the sets themselves) are the same. Since `setLeft`
and `setRight` are both instances of the Set object and contain the same elements, shallow considers
them equal.

```ts
const setLeft = new Set([1, 2, 3])
const setRight = new Set([1, 2, 3])

Object.is(setLeft, setRight) // -> false
shallow(setLeft, setRight) // -> true
```

### Comparing Maps

When comparing maps, it's important to understand how `Object.is` and `shallow` function operate, as
they handle comparisons differently.

The `shallow` returns `true` because shallow performs a shallow comparison of the maps. It checks if
the top-level properties (in this case, the maps themselves) are the same. Since `mapLeft` and
`mapRight` are both instances of the Map object and contain the same key-value pairs, shallow
considers them equal.

```ts
const mapLeft = new Map([
  [1, 'one'],
  [2, 'two'],
  [3, 'three'],
])
const mapRight = new Map([
  [1, 'one'],
  [2, 'two'],
  [3, 'three'],
])

Object.is(mapLeft, mapRight) // -> false
shallow(mapLeft, mapRight) // -> true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Comparing objects returns `false` even if they are identical

The `shallow` function performs a shallow comparison. A shallow comparison checks if the top-level
properties of two objects are equal. It does not check nested objects or deeply nested properties.
In other words, it only compares the references of the properties.

In the following example, the shallow function returns `false` because it compares only the
top-level properties and their references. The address property in both objects is a nested object,
and even though their contents are identical, their references are different. Consequently, shallow
sees them as different, resulting in `false`.

```ts
const objectLeft = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: 'Kulas Light',
    suite: 'Apt. 556',
    city: 'Gwenborough',
    zipcode: '92998-3874',
    geo: {
      lat: '-37.3159',
      lng: '81.1496',
    },
  },
}
const objectRight = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: 'Kulas Light',
    suite: 'Apt. 556',
    city: 'Gwenborough',
    zipcode: '92998-3874',
    geo: {
      lat: '-37.3159',
      lng: '81.1496',
    },
  },
}

Object.is(objectLeft, objectRight) // -> false
shallow(objectLeft, objectRight) // -> false
```

If we remove the `address` property, the shallow comparison would work as expected because all
top-level properties would be primitive values or references to the same values:

```ts
const objectLeft = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
}
const objectRight = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
}

Object.is(objectLeft, objectRight) // -> false
shallow(objectLeft, objectRight) // -> true
```

In this modified example, `objectLeft` and `objectRight` have the same top-level properties and
primitive values. Since `shallow` function only compares the top-level properties, it will return
`true` because the primitive values (`firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`) are identical in both
objects.

### Comparing objects with different prototypes

The `shallow` function checks whether the two objects have the same prototype. If their prototypes
are referentially different, shallow will return `false`. This comparison is done using:

```ts
Object.getPrototypeOf(a) === Object.getPrototypeOf(b)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Objects created with the object initializer (`{}`) or with `new Object()` inherit from
> `Object.prototype` by default. However, objects created with `Object.create(proto)` inherit from
> the proto you pass in—which may not be `Object.prototype.`

```ts
const a = Object.create({}) // -> prototype is `{}`
const b = {} // -> prototype is `Object.prototype`

shallow(a, b) // -> false
```

## Types

### Signature

```ts
useStore<StoreApi<T>, U = T>(store: StoreApi<T>, selectorFn?: (state: T) => U) => UseBoundStore<StoreApi<T>>
```

## Reference

### `useStore(store, selectorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `storeApi`: The instance that lets you access to store API utilities.
- `selectorFn`: A function that lets you return data that is based on current state.

#### Returns

`useStore` returns any data based on current state depending on the selector function. It should
take a store, and a selector function as arguments.

## Usage

### Using a global vanilla store in React

First, let's set up a store that will hold the position of the dot on the screen. We'll define the
store to manage `x` and `y` coordinates and provide an action to update these coordinates.

```tsx
type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
}))
```

Next, we'll create a `MovingDot` component that renders a div representing the dot. This component
will use the store to track and update the dot's position.

```tsx
function MovingDot() {
  const position = useStore(positionStore, (state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = useStore(positionStore, (state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, we’ll render the `MovingDot` component in our `App` component.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <MovingDot />
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
}))

function MovingDot() {
  const position = useStore(positionStore, (state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = useStore(positionStore, (state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return <MovingDot />
}
```

### Using dynamic global vanilla stores in React

First, we'll create a factory function that generates a store for managing the counter state.
Each tab will have its own instance of this store.

```ts
type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}
```

Next, we'll create a factory function that manages the creation and retrieval of counter stores.
This allows each tab to have its own independent counter.

```ts
const defaultCounterStores = new Map<
  string,
  ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>
>()

const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: typeof defaultCounterStores,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}

const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey =
  createCounterStoreFactory(defaultCounterStores)
```

Now, let’s build the Tabs component, where users can switch between tabs and increment each tab’s
counter.

```tsx
const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
const counterState = useStore(
  getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(`tab-${currentTabIndex}`),
)

return (
  <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        gap: '0.5rem',
        borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
        paddingBottom: 4,
      }}
    >
      <button
        type="button"
        style={{
          border: '1px solid salmon',
          backgroundColor: '#fff',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
        onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
      >
        Tab 1
      </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        style={{
          border: '1px solid salmon',
          backgroundColor: '#fff',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
        onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
      >
        Tab 2
      </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        style={{
          border: '1px solid salmon',
          backgroundColor: '#fff',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
        onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
      >
        Tab 3
      </button>
    </div>
    <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
      Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
      <br /> <br />
      <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
        Count: {counterState.count}
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

Finally, we'll create the `App` component, which renders the tabs and their respective counters.
The counter state is managed independently for each tab.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <Tabs />
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}

const defaultCounterStores = new Map<
  string,
  ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>
>()

const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: typeof defaultCounterStores,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}

const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey =
  createCounterStoreFactory(defaultCounterStores)

export default function App() {
  const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
  const counterState = useStore(
    getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(`tab-${currentTabIndex}`),
  )

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          gap: '0.5rem',
          borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
          paddingBottom: 4,
        }}
      >
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
        >
          Tab 1
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
        >
          Tab 2
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
        >
          Tab 3
        </button>
      </div>
      <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
        Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
        <br /> <br />
        <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
          Count: {counterState.count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using scoped (non-global) vanilla store in React

First, let's set up a store that will hold the position of the dot on the screen. We'll define the
store to manage `x` and `y` coordinates and provide an action to update these coordinates.

```tsx
type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const createPositionStore = () => {
  return createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  }))
}
```

Next, we'll create a context and a provider component to pass down the store through the React
component tree. This allows each `MovingDot` component to have its own independent state.

```tsx
const PositionStoreContext = createContext<ReturnType<
  typeof createPositionStore
> | null>(null)

function PositionStoreProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [store] = useState(() => createPositionStore())
  return (
    <PositionStoreContext.Provider value={store}>
      {children}
    </PositionStoreContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

To simplify accessing the store, we’ll create a React custom hook, `usePositionStore`. This hook
will read the store from the context and allow us to select specific parts of the state.

```ts
function usePositionStore<U>(selector: (state: PositionStore) => U) {
  const store = useContext(PositionStoreContext)

  if (store === null) {
    throw new Error(
      'usePositionStore must be used within PositionStoreProvider',
    )
  }

  return useStore(store, selector)
}
```

Now, let's create the `MovingDot` component, which will render a dot that follows the mouse cursor
within its container.

```tsx
function MovingDot({ color }: { color: string }) {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x:
            e.clientX > e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              ? e.clientX - e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              : e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '50vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: color,
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, we'll bring everything together in the `App` component, where we render two `MovingDot`
components, each with its own independent state.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="red" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="blue" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { type ReactNode, useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react'
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const createPositionStore = () => {
  return createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  }))
}

const PositionStoreContext = createContext<ReturnType<
  typeof createPositionStore
> | null>(null)

function PositionStoreProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [store] = useState(() => createPositionStore())
  return (
    <PositionStoreContext.Provider value={store}>
      {children}
    </PositionStoreContext.Provider>
  )
}

function usePositionStore<U>(selector: (state: PositionStore) => U) {
  const store = useContext(PositionStoreContext)

  if (store === null) {
    throw new Error(
      'usePositionStore must be used within PositionStoreProvider',
    )
  }

  return useStore(store, selector)
}

function MovingDot({ color }: { color: string }) {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x:
            e.clientX > e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              ? e.clientX - e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              : e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '50vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: color,
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="red" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="blue" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using dynamic scoped (non-global) vanilla stores in React

First, we'll create a factory function that generates a store for managing the counter state.
Each tab will have its own instance of this store.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}
```

Next, we'll create a factory function that manages the creation and retrieval of counter stores.
This allows each tab to have its own independent counter.

```ts
const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}
```

Next, we need a way to manage and access these stores throughout our app. We’ll use React’s context
for this.

```tsx
const CounterStoresContext = createContext(null)

const CounterStoresProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [stores] = useState(
    () => new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>(),
  )

  return (
    <CounterStoresContext.Provider value={stores}>
      {children}
    </CounterStoresContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Now, we’ll create a custom hook, `useCounterStore`, that lets us access the correct store for a
given tab.

```tsx
const useCounterStore = <U>(
  currentTabIndex: number,
  selector: (state: CounterStore) => U,
) => {
  const stores = useContext(CounterStoresContext)

  if (stores === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCounterStore must be used within CounterStoresProvider')
  }

  const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey = useCallback(
    () => createCounterStoreFactory(stores),
    [stores],
  )

  return useStore(getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(`tab-${currentTabIndex}`))
}
```

Now, let’s build the Tabs component, where users can switch between tabs and increment each tab’s
counter.

```tsx
function Tabs() {
  const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
  const counterState = useCounterStore(
    `tab-${currentTabIndex}`,
    (state) => state,
  )

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          gap: '0.5rem',
          borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
          paddingBottom: 4,
        }}
      >
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
        >
          Tab 1
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
        >
          Tab 2
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
        >
          Tab 3
        </button>
      </div>
      <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
        Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
        <br /> <br />
        <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
          Count: {counterState.count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, we'll create the `App` component, which renders the tabs and their respective counters.
The counter state is managed independently for each tab.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <CounterStoresProvider>
      <Tabs />
    </CounterStoresProvider>
  )
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import {
  type ReactNode,
  useState,
  useCallback,
  useContext,
  createContext,
} from 'react'
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}

const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}

const CounterStoresContext = createContext<Map<
  string,
  ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>
> | null>(null)

const CounterStoresProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [stores] = useState(
    () => new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>(),
  )

  return (
    <CounterStoresContext.Provider value={stores}>
      {children}
    </CounterStoresContext.Provider>
  )
}

const useCounterStore = <U,>(
  key: string,
  selector: (state: CounterStore) => U,
) => {
  const stores = useContext(CounterStoresContext)

  if (stores === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCounterStore must be used within CounterStoresProvider')
  }

  const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey = useCallback(
    (key: string) => createCounterStoreFactory(stores!)(key),
    [stores],
  )

  return useStore(getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(key), selector)

export default function App() {

`useStoreWithEqualityFn` is a React Hook that lets you use a vanilla store in React, just like
`useStore`. However, it offers a way to define a custom equality check. This allows for more
granular control over when components re-render, improving performance and responsiveness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to use `useStoreWithEqualityFn` from `zustand/traditional` you need to install
> `use-sync-external-store` library due to `zustand/traditional` relies on `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector`.

```js
const someState = useStoreWithEqualityFn(store, selectorFn, equalityFn)
```

## Types

### Signature

```ts
useStoreWithEqualityFn<T, U = T>(store: StoreApi<T>, selectorFn: (state: T) => U, equalityFn?: (a: T, b: T) => boolean): U
```

## Reference

### `useStoreWithEqualityFn(store, selectorFn, equalityFn)`

#### Parameters

- `storeApi`: The instance that lets you access to store API utilities.
- `selectorFn`: A function that lets you return data that is based on current state.
- `equalityFn`: A function that lets you skip re-renders.

#### Returns

`useStoreWithEqualityFn` returns any data based on current state depending on the selector function,
and lets you skip re-renders using an equality function. It should take a store, a selector
function, and an equality function as arguments.

## Usage

### Using a global vanilla store in React

First, let's set up a store that will hold the position of the dot on the screen. We'll define the
store to manage `x` and `y` coordinates and provide an action to update these coordinates.

```tsx
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
}))
```

Next, we'll create a `MovingDot` component that renders a div representing the dot. This component
will use the store to track and update the dot's position.

```tsx
function MovingDot() {
  const position = useStoreWithEqualityFn(
    positionStore,
    (state) => state.position,
    shallow,
  )
  const setPosition = useStoreWithEqualityFn(
    positionStore,
    (state) => state.setPosition,
    shallow,
  )

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, we’ll render the `MovingDot` component in our `App` component.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <MovingDot />
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { createStore } from 'zustand'
import { useStoreWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
}))

function MovingDot() {
  const position = useStoreWithEqualityFn(
    positionStore,
    (state) => state.position,
    shallow,
  )
  const setPosition = useStoreWithEqualityFn(
    positionStore,
    (state) => state.setPosition,
    shallow,
  )

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return <MovingDot />
}
```

### Using dynamic global vanilla stores in React

First, we'll create a factory function that generates a store for managing the counter state.
Each tab will have its own instance of this store.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}
```

Next, we'll create a factory function that manages the creation and retrieval of counter stores.
This allows each tab to have its own independent counter.

```ts
const defaultCounterStores = new Map<
  string,
  ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>
>()

const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: typeof defaultCounterStores,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}

const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey =
  createCounterStoreFactory(defaultCounterStores)
```

Now, let’s build the Tabs component, where users can switch between tabs and increment each tab’s
counter.

```tsx
const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
const counterState = useStoreWithEqualityFn(
  getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(`tab-${currentTabIndex}`),
  (state) => state,
  shallow,
)

return (
  <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        gap: '0.5rem',
        borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
        paddingBottom: 4,
      }}
    >
      <button
        type="button"
        style={{
          border: '1px solid salmon',
          backgroundColor: '#fff',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
        onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
      >
        Tab 1
      </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        style={{
          border: '1px solid salmon',
          backgroundColor: '#fff',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
        onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
      >
        Tab 2
      </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        style={{
          border: '1px solid salmon',
          backgroundColor: '#fff',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
        onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
      >
        Tab 3
      </button>
    </div>
    <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
      Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
      <br /> <br />
      <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
        Count: {counterState.count}
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

Finally, we'll create the `App` component, which renders the tabs and their respective counters.
The counter state is managed independently for each tab.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <Tabs />
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { createStore } from 'zustand'
import { useStoreWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}

const defaultCounterStores = new Map<
  string,
  ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>
>()

const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: typeof defaultCounterStores,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}

const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey =
  createCounterStoreFactory(defaultCounterStores)

export default function App() {
  const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
  const counterState = useStoreWithEqualityFn(
    getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(`tab-${currentTabIndex}`),
    (state) => state,
    shallow,
  )

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          gap: '0.5rem',
          borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
          paddingBottom: 4,
        }}
      >
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
        >
          Tab 1
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
        >
          Tab 2
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
        >
          Tab 3
        </button>
      </div>
      <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
        Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
        <br /> <br />
        <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
          Count: {counterState.count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using scoped (non-global) vanilla store in React

First, let's set up a store that will hold the position of the dot on the screen. We'll define the
store to manage `x` and `y` coordinates and provide an action to update these coordinates.

```tsx
type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const createPositionStore = () => {
  return createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  }))
}
```

Next, we'll create a context and a provider component to pass down the store through the React
component tree. This allows each `MovingDot` component to have its own independent state.

```tsx
const PositionStoreContext = createContext<ReturnType<
  typeof createPositionStore
> | null>(null)

function PositionStoreProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [store] = useState(() => createPositionStore())
  return (
    <PositionStoreContext.Provider value={store}>
      {children}
    </PositionStoreContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

To simplify accessing the store, we’ll create a React custom hook, `usePositionStore`. This hook
will read the store from the context and allow us to select specific parts of the state.

```ts
function usePositionStore<U>(selector: (state: PositionStore) => U) {
  const store = useContext(PositionStoreContext)

  if (store === null) {
    throw new Error(
      'usePositionStore must be used within PositionStoreProvider',
    )
  }

  return useStoreWithEqualityFn(store, selector, shallow)
}
```

Now, let's create the `MovingDot` component, which will render a dot that follows the mouse cursor
within its container.

```tsx
function MovingDot({ color }: { color: string }) {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x:
            e.clientX > e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              ? e.clientX - e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              : e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '50vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: color,
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, we'll bring everything together in the `App` component, where we render two `MovingDot`
components, each with its own independent state.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="red" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="blue" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { type ReactNode, useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react'
import { createStore } from 'zustand'
import { useStoreWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const createPositionStore = () => {
  return createStore<PositionStore>()((set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  }))
}

const PositionStoreContext = createContext<ReturnType<
  typeof createPositionStore
> | null>(null)

function PositionStoreProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [store] = useState(() => createPositionStore())
  return (
    <PositionStoreContext.Provider value={store}>
      {children}
    </PositionStoreContext.Provider>
  )
}

function usePositionStore<U>(selector: (state: PositionStore) => U) {
  const store = useContext(PositionStoreContext)

  if (store === null) {
    throw new Error(
      'usePositionStore must be used within PositionStoreProvider',
    )
  }

  return useStoreWithEqualityFn(store, selector, shallow)
}

function MovingDot({ color }: { color: string }) {
  const position = usePositionStore((state) => state.position)
  const setPosition = usePositionStore((state) => state.setPosition)

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={(e) => {
        setPosition({
          x:
            e.clientX > e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              ? e.clientX - e.currentTarget.clientWidth
              : e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY,
        })
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '50vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          backgroundColor: color,
          borderRadius: '50%',
          transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
          left: -10,
          top: -10,
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="red" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
      <PositionStoreProvider>
        <MovingDot color="blue" />
      </PositionStoreProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using dynamic scoped (non-global) vanilla stores in React

First, we'll create a factory function that generates a store for managing the counter state.
Each tab will have its own instance of this store.

```ts
type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}
```

Next, we'll create a factory function that manages the creation and retrieval of counter stores.
This allows each tab to have its own independent counter.

```ts
const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}
```

Next, we need a way to manage and access these stores throughout our app. We’ll use React’s context
for this.

```tsx
const CounterStoresContext = createContext(null)

const CounterStoresProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [stores] = useState(
    () => new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>(),
  )

  return (
    <CounterStoresContext.Provider value={stores}>
      {children}
    </CounterStoresContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Now, we’ll create a custom hook, `useCounterStore`, that lets us access the correct store for a
given tab.

```tsx
const useCounterStore = <U,>(
  key: string,
  selector: (state: CounterStore) => U,
) => {
  const stores = useContext(CounterStoresContext)

  if (stores === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCounterStore must be used within CounterStoresProvider')
  }

  const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey = useCallback(
    (key: string) => createCounterStoreFactory(stores!)(key),
    [stores],
  )

  return useStore(getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(key), selector)
}
```

Now, let’s build the Tabs component, where users can switch between tabs and increment each tab’s
counter.

```tsx
function Tabs() {
  const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
  const counterState = useCounterStore(
    `tab-${currentTabIndex}`,
    (state) => state,
  )

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          gap: '0.5rem',
          borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
          paddingBottom: 4,
        }}
      >
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
        >
          Tab 1
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
        >
          Tab 2
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
        >
          Tab 3
        </button>
      </div>
      <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
        Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
        <br /> <br />
        <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
          Count: {counterState.count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, we'll create the `App` component, which renders the tabs and their respective counters.
The counter state is managed independently for each tab.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <CounterStoresProvider>
      <Tabs />
    </CounterStoresProvider>
  )
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import {
  type ReactNode,
  useState,
  useCallback,
  useContext,
  createContext,
} from 'react'
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

type CounterState = {
  count: number
}

type CounterActions = { increment: () => void }

type CounterStore = CounterState & CounterActions

const createCounterStore = () => {
  return createStore<CounterStore>()((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => {
      set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    },
  }))
}

const createCounterStoreFactory = (
  counterStores: Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>,
) => {
  return (counterStoreKey: string) => {
    if (!counterStores.has(counterStoreKey)) {
      counterStores.set(counterStoreKey, createCounterStore())
    }
    return counterStores.get(counterStoreKey)!
  }
}

const CounterStoresContext = createContext<Map<
  string,
  ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>
> | null>(null)

const CounterStoresProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [stores] = useState(
    () => new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createCounterStore>>(),
  )

  return (
    <CounterStoresContext.Provider value={stores}>
      {children}
    </CounterStoresContext.Provider>
  )
}

const useCounterStore = <U,>(
  key: string,
  selector: (state: CounterStore) => U,
) => {
  const stores = useContext(CounterStoresContext)

  if (stores === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCounterStore must be used within CounterStoresProvider')
  }

  const getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey = useCallback(
    (key: string) => createCounterStoreFactory(stores!)(key),
    [stores],
  )

  return useStore(getOrCreateCounterStoreByKey(key), selector)
}

function Tabs() {
  const [currentTabIndex, setCurrentTabIndex] = useState(0)
  const counterState = useCounterStore(
    `tab-${currentTabIndex}`,
    (state) => state,
  )

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          gap: '0.5rem',
          borderBottom: '1px solid salmon',
          paddingBottom: 4,
        }}
      >
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(0)}
        >
          Tab 1
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(1)}
        >
          Tab 2
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          style={{
            border: '1px solid salmon',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
          onClick={() => setCurrentTabIndex(2)}
        >
          Tab 3
        </button>
      </div>
      <div style={{ padding: 4 }}>
        Content of Tab {currentTabIndex + 1}
        <br /> <br />
        <button type="button" onClick={() => counterState.increment()}>
          Count: {counterState.count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CounterStoresProvider>
      <Tabs />
    </CounterStoresProvider>
  )
}
```

title: useShallow
description: How to memoize selector functions
tag: react
nav: 27

`useShallow` is a React Hook that lets you optimize re-renders.

```js
const memoizedSelector = useShallow(selector)
```

- [Types](#types)
  - [Signature](#signature)
- [Reference](#reference)
- [Usage](#usage)
  - [Writing a memoized selector](#writing-a-memoized-selector)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Types

### Signature

```ts
useShallow<T, U = T>(selectorFn: (state: T) => U): (state: T) => U
```

## Reference

### `useShallow(selectorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `selectorFn`: A function that lets you return data that is based on current state.

#### Returns

`useShallow` returns a memoized version of a selector function using a shallow comparison for
memoization.

## Usage

### Writing a memoized selector

First, we need to setup a store to hold the state for the bear family. In this store, we define
three properties: `papaBear`, `mamaBear`, and `babyBear`, each representing a different member of
the bear family and their respective oatmeal pot sizes.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

type BearFamilyMealsStore = {
  [key: string]: string
}

const useBearFamilyMealsStore = create<BearFamilyMealsStore>()(() => ({
  papaBear: 'large porridge-pot',
  mamaBear: 'middle-size porridge pot',
  babyBear: 'A little, small, wee pot',
}))
```

Next, we'll create a `BearNames` component that retrieves the keys of our state (the bear family
members) and displays them.

```tsx
function BearNames() {
  const names = useBearFamilyMealsStore((state) => Object.keys(state))

  return <div>{names.join(', ')}</div>
}
```

Next, we will create a `UpdateBabyBearMeal` component that periodically updates baby bear's meal
choice.

```tsx
const meals = [
  'A tiny, little, wee bowl',
  'A small, petite, tiny pot',
  'A wee, itty-bitty, small bowl',
  'A little, petite, tiny dish',
  'A tiny, small, wee vessel',
  'A small, little, wee cauldron',
  'A little, tiny, small cup',
  'A wee, small, little jar',
  'A tiny, wee, small pan',
  'A small, wee, little crock',
]

function UpdateBabyBearMeal() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      useBearFamilyMealsStore.setState({
        babyBear: meals[Math.floor(Math.random() * (meals.length - 1))],
      })
    }, 1000)

    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer)
    }
  }, [])

  return null
}
```

Finally, we combine both components in the `App` component to see them in action.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <UpdateBabyBearMeal />
      <BearNames />
    </>
  )
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { create } from 'zustand'

type BearFamilyMealsStore = {
  [key: string]: string
}

const useBearFamilyMealsStore = create<BearFamilyMealsStore>()(() => ({
  papaBear: 'large porridge-pot',
  mamaBear: 'middle-size porridge pot',
  babyBear: 'A little, small, wee pot',
}))

const meals = [
  'A tiny, little, wee bowl',
  'A small, petite, tiny pot',
  'A wee, itty-bitty, small bowl',
  'A little, petite, tiny dish',
  'A tiny, small, wee vessel',
  'A small, little, wee cauldron',
  'A little, tiny, small cup',
  'A wee, small, little jar',
  'A tiny, wee, small pan',
  'A small, wee, little crock',
]

function UpdateBabyBearMeal() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      useBearFamilyMealsStore.setState({
        babyBear: meals[Math.floor(Math.random() * (meals.length - 1))],
      })
    }, 1000)

    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer)
    }
  }, [])

  return null
}

function BearNames() {
  const names = useBearFamilyMealsStore((state) => Object.keys(state))

  return <div>{names.join(', ')}</div>
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <UpdateBabyBearMeal />
      <BearNames />
    </>
  )
}
```

Everything might look fine, but there’s a small problem: the `BearNames` component keeps
re-rendering even if the names haven’t changed. This happens because the component re-renders
whenever any part of the state changes, even if the specific part we care about (the list of names) hasn’t changed.

To fix this, we use `useShallow` to make sure the component only re-renders when the actual keys of
the state change:

```tsx
function BearNames() {
  const names = useBearFamilyMealsStore(
    useShallow((state) => Object.keys(state)),
  )

  return <div>{names.join(', ')}</div>
}
```

Here is what the code should look like:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/react/shallow'

type BearFamilyMealsStore = {
  [key: string]: string
}

const useBearFamilyMealsStore = create<BearFamilyMealsStore>()(() => ({
  papaBear: 'large porridge-pot',
  mamaBear: 'middle-size porridge pot',
  babyBear: 'A little, small, wee pot',
}))

const meals = [
  'A tiny, little, wee bowl',
  'A small, petite, tiny pot',
  'A wee, itty-bitty, small bowl',
  'A little, petite, tiny dish',
  'A tiny, small, wee vessel',
  'A small, little, wee cauldron',
  'A little, tiny, small cup',
  'A wee, small, little jar',
  'A tiny, wee, small pan',
  'A small, wee, little crock',
]

function UpdateBabyBearMeal() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      useBearFamilyMealsStore.setState({
        babyBear: meals[Math.floor(Math.random() * (meals.length - 1))],
      })
    }, 1000)

    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer)
    }
  }, [])

  return null
}

function BearNames() {
  const names = useBearFamilyMealsStore(
    useShallow((state) => Object.keys(state)),
  )

  return <div>{names.join(', ')}</div>
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <UpdateBabyBearMeal />
      <BearNames />
    </>
  )
}
```

By using `useShallow`, we optimized the rendering process, ensuring that the component only
re-renders when necessary, which improves overall performance.

## Troubleshooting

TBD


<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/reference/integrations/persisting-store-data.md -->

---
title: Persisting store data
nav: 34
---

The Persist middleware enables you to store
your Zustand state in a storage
(e.g., `localStorage`, `AsyncStorage`, `IndexedDB`, etc.),
thus persisting its data.

Note that this middleware supports both
synchronous storages, like `localStorage`,
and asynchronous storages, like `AsyncStorage`,
but using an asynchronous storage does come with a cost.
See [Hydration and asynchronous storages](#hydration-and-asynchronous-storages)
for more details.

## Simple example

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

export const useBearStore = create()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      bears: 0,
      addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage', // name of the item in the storage (must be unique)
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => sessionStorage), // (optional) by default, 'localStorage' is used
    },
  ),
)
```

## Typescript simple example

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

type BearStore = {
  bears: number
  addABear: () => void
}

export const useBearStore = create<BearStore>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      bears: 0,
      addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage', // name of the item in the storage (must be unique)
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => sessionStorage), // (optional) by default, 'localStorage' is used
    },
  ),
)
```

## Options

### `name`

This is the only required option.
The given name is going to be the key
used to store your Zustand state in the storage,
so it must be unique.

### `storage`

> Type: `() => StateStorage`

The `StateStorage` can be imported with:

```ts
import { StateStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'
```

> Default: `createJSONStorage(() => localStorage)`

Enables you to use your own storage. Simply pass a function that returns the storage you want to use. It's recommended to use the [`createJSONStorage`](#createjsonstorage) helper function to create a `storage` object that is compliant with the `StateStorage` interface.

Example:

```ts
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // ...
    }),
    {
      // ...
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage),
    },
  ),
)
```

### `partialize`

> Type: `(state: Object) => Object`

> Default: `(state) => state`

Enables you to pick some of the state's fields to be stored in the storage.

You could omit multiple fields using the following:

```ts
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      foo: 0,
      bar: 1,
    }),
    {
      // ...
      partialize: (state) =>
        Object.fromEntries(
          Object.entries(state).filter(([key]) => !['foo'].includes(key)),
        ),
    },
  ),
)
```

Or you could allow only specific fields using the following:

```ts
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      foo: 0,
      bar: 1,
    }),
    {
      // ...
      partialize: (state) => ({ foo: state.foo }),
    },
  ),
)
```

### `onRehydrateStorage`

> Type: `(state: Object) => ((state?: Object, error?: Error) => void) | void`

This option enables you to pass a listener function
that will be called when the storage is hydrated.

Example:

```ts
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // ...
    }),
    {
      // ...
      onRehydrateStorage: (state) => {
        console.log('hydration starts')

        // optional
        return (state, error) => {
          if (error) {
            console.log('an error happened during hydration', error)
          } else {
            console.log('hydration finished')
          }
        }
      },
    },
  ),
)
```

### `version`

> Type: `number`

> Default: `0`

If you want to introduce a breaking change in your storage
(e.g. renaming a field), you can specify a new version number.
By default, if the version in the storage
does not match the version in the code,
the stored value won't be used.
You can use the [migrate](#migrate) function (see below)
to handle breaking changes in order to persist previously stored data.

### `migrate`

> Type: `(persistedState: Object, version: number) => Object | Promise<Object>`

> Default: `(persistedState) => persistedState`

You can use this option to handle versions migration.
The migrate function takes the persisted state
and the version number as arguments.
It must return a state that is compliant
to the latest version (the version in the code).

For instance, if you want to rename a field, you can use the following:

```ts
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      newField: 0, // let's say this field was named otherwise in version 0
    }),
    {
      // ...
      version: 1, // a migration will be triggered if the version in the storage mismatches this one
      migrate: (persistedState, version) => {
        if (version === 0) {
          // if the stored value is in version 0, we rename the field to the new name
          persistedState.newField = persistedState.oldField
          delete persistedState.oldField
        }

        return persistedState
      },
    },
  ),
)
```

### `merge`

> Type: `(persistedState: Object, currentState: Object) => Object`

> Default: `(persistedState, currentState) => ({ ...currentState, ...persistedState })`

In some cases, you might want to use a custom merge function
to merge the persisted value with the current state.

By default, the middleware does a shallow merge.
The shallow merge might not be enough
if you have partially persisted nested objects.
For instance, if the storage contains the following:

```ts
{
  foo: {
    bar: 0,
  }
}
```

But your Zustand store contains:

```ts
{
  foo: {
    bar: 0,
    baz: 1,
  }
}
```

The shallow merge will erase the `baz` field from the `foo` object.
One way to fix this would be to give a custom deep merge function:

```ts
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      foo: {
        bar: 0,
        baz: 1,
      },
    }),
    {
      // ...
      merge: (persistedState, currentState) =>
        deepMerge(currentState, persistedState),
    },
  ),
)
```

### `skipHydration`

> Type: `boolean | undefined`

> Default: `undefined`

By default the store will be hydrated on initialization.

In some applications you may need to control when the first hydration occurs.
For example, in server-rendered apps.

If you set `skipHydration`, the initial call for hydration isn't called,
and it is left up to you to manually call `rehydrate()`.

```ts
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    () => ({
      count: 0,
      // ...
    }),
    {
      // ...
      skipHydration: true,
    },
  ),
)
```

```tsx
import { useBoundStore } from './path-to-store';

export function StoreConsumer() {
  // hydrate persisted store after on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    useBoundStore.persist.rehydrate();
  }, [])

  return (
    //...
  )
}
```

## API

> Version: >=3.6.3

The Persist API enables you to do a number of interactions
with the Persist middleware
from inside or outside of a React component.

### `getOptions`

> Type: `() => Partial<PersistOptions>`

> Returns: Options of the Persist middleware

For example, it can be used to obtain the storage name:

```ts
useBoundStore.persist.getOptions().name
```

### `setOptions`

> Type: `(newOptions: Partial<PersistOptions>) => void`

Changes the middleware options.
Note that the new options will be merged with the current ones.

For instance, this can be used to change the storage name:

```ts
useBoundStore.persist.setOptions({
  name: 'new-name',
})
```

Or even to change the storage engine:

```ts
useBoundStore.persist.setOptions({
  storage: createJSONStorage(() => sessionStorage),
})
```

### `clearStorage`

> Type: `() => void`

Clears everything stored under the [name](#name) key.

```ts
useBoundStore.persist.clearStorage()
```

### `rehydrate`

> Type: `() => Promise<void>`

In some cases, you might want to trigger the rehydration manually.
This can be done by calling the `rehydrate` method.

```ts
await useBoundStore.persist.rehydrate()
```

### `hasHydrated`

> Type: `() => boolean`

This is a non-reactive getter to check
if the storage has been hydrated
(note that it updates when calling [`rehydrate`](#rehydrate)).

```ts
useBoundStore.persist.hasHydrated()
```

### `onHydrate`

> Type: `(listener: (state) => void) => () => void`

> Returns: Unsubscribe function

This listener will be called when the hydration process starts.

```ts
const unsub = useBoundStore.persist.onHydrate((state) => {
  console.log('hydration starts')
})

// later on...
unsub()
```

### `onFinishHydration`

> Type: `(listener: (state) => void) => () => void`

> Returns: Unsubscribe function

This listener will be called when the hydration process ends.

```ts
const unsub = useBoundStore.persist.onFinishHydration((state) => {
  console.log('hydration finished')
})

// later on...
unsub()
```

### `createJSONStorage`

> Type: `(getStorage: () => StateStorage, options?: JsonStorageOptions) => StateStorage`

> Returns: `PersistStorage`

This helper function enables you to create a [`storage`](#storage) object which is useful when you want to use a custom storage engine.

`getStorage` is a function that returns the storage engine with the properties `getItem`, `setItem`, and `removeItem`.

`options` is an optional object that can be used to customize the serialization and deserialization of the data. `options.reviver` is a function that is passed to `JSON.parse` to deserialize the data. `options.replacer` is a function that is passed to `JSON.stringify` to serialize the data.

```ts
import { createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

const storage = createJSONStorage(() => sessionStorage, {
  reviver: (key, value) => {
    if (value && value.type === 'date') {
      return new Date(value)
    }
    return value
  },
  replacer: (key, value) => {
    // NOTE: the result of `.toJSON()` is passed to the
    // replacer function as value if is available so
    // a Date is always a `string` at this point
    if (key === 'someDate') return { type: 'date', value }
    return value
  },
})
```

## Hydration and asynchronous storages

To explain what is the "cost" of asynchronous storages,
you need to understand what is hydration.

In a nutshell, hydration is a process
of retrieving persisted state from the storage
and merging it with the current state.

The Persist middleware does two kinds of hydration:
synchronous and asynchronous.
If the given storage is synchronous (e.g., `localStorage`),
hydration will be done synchronously.
On the other hand, if the given storage is asynchronous (e.g., `AsyncStorage`),
hydration will be done asynchronously (shocking, I know!).

But what's the catch?
With synchronous hydration,
the Zustand store will already have been hydrated at its creation.
In contrast, with asynchronous hydration,
the Zustand store will be hydrated later on, in a microtask.

Why does it matter?
Asynchronous hydration can cause some unexpected behaviors.
For instance, if you use Zustand in a React app,
the store will **not** be hydrated at the initial render.
In cases where your app depends on the persisted value at page load,
you might want to wait until
the store has been hydrated before showing anything.
For example, your app might think the user
is not logged in because it's the default,
but in reality the store has not been hydrated yet.

If your app does depends on the persisted state at page load,
see [_How can I check if my store has been hydrated_](#how-can-i-check-if-my-store-has-been-hydrated)
in the [FAQ](#faq) section below.

### Usage in Next.js

NextJS uses Server Side Rendering, and it will compare the rendered component on the server with the one rendered on client.
But since you are using data from browser to change your component, the two renders will differ and Next will throw a warning at you.

The errors usually are:

- Text content does not match server-rendered HTML
- Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server
- There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering

To solve these errors, create a custom hook so that Zustand waits a little before changing your components.

Create a file with the following:

```ts
// useStore.ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const useStore = <T, F>(
  store: (callback: (state: T) => unknown) => unknown,
  callback: (state: T) => F,
) => {
  const result = store(callback) as F
  const [data, setData] = useState<F>()

  useEffect(() => {
    setData(result)
  }, [result])

  return data
}

export default useStore
```

Now in your pages, you will use the hook a little bit differently:

```ts
// useBearStore.ts

import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

// the store itself does not need any change
export const useBearStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      bears: 0,
      addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage',
    },
  ),
)
```

```ts
// yourComponent.tsx

import useStore from './useStore'
import { useBearStore } from './stores/useBearStore'

const bears = useStore(useBearStore, (state) => state.bears)
```

## FAQ

### How can I check if my store has been hydrated

There are a few different ways to do this.

You can use the [`onRehydrateStorage`](#onrehydratestorage)
listener function to update a field in the store:

```ts
const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // ...
      _hasHydrated: false,
      setHasHydrated: (state) => {
        set({
          _hasHydrated: state
        });
      }
    }),
    {
      // ...
      onRehydrateStorage: (state) => {
        return () => state.setHasHydrated(true)
      }
    }
  )
);

export default function App() {
  const hasHydrated = useBoundStore(state => state._hasHydrated);

  if (!hasHydrated) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

You can also create a custom `useHydration` hook:

```ts
const useBoundStore = create(persist(...))

const useHydration = () => {
  const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Note: This is just in case you want to take into account manual rehydration.
    // You can remove the following line if you don't need it.
    const unsubHydrate = useBoundStore.persist.onHydrate(() => setHydrated(false))

    const unsubFinishHydration = useBoundStore.persist.onFinishHydration(() => setHydrated(true))

    setHydrated(useBoundStore.persist.hasHydrated())

    return () => {
      unsubHydrate()
      unsubFinishHydration()
    }
  }, [])

  return hydrated
}
```

### How can I use a custom storage engine

If the storage you want to use does not match the expected API, you can create your own storage:

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, createJSONStorage, StateStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'
import { get, set, del } from 'idb-keyval' // can use anything: IndexedDB, Ionic Storage, etc.

// Custom storage object
const storage: StateStorage = {
  getItem: async (name: string): Promise<string | null> => {
    console.log(name, 'has been retrieved')
    return (await get(name)) || null
  },
  setItem: async (name: string, value: string): Promise<void> => {
    console.log(name, 'with value', value, 'has been saved')
    await set(name, value)
  },
  removeItem: async (name: string): Promise<void> => {
    console.log(name, 'has been deleted')
    await del(name)
  },
}

export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      bears: 0,
      addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage', // unique name
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => storage),
    },
  ),
)
```

If you're using a type that `JSON.stringify()` doesn't support, you'll need to write your own serialization/deserialization code. However, if this is tedious, you can use third-party libraries to serialize and deserialize different types of data.

For example, [Superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) can serialize data along with its type, allowing the data to be parsed back to its original type upon deserialization

```ts
import superjson from 'superjson' //  can use anything: serialize-javascript, devalue, etc.
import { PersistStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface BearState {
  bear: Map<string, string>
  fish: Set<string>
  time: Date
  query: RegExp
}

const storage: PersistStorage<BearState> = {
  getItem: (name) => {
    const str = localStorage.getItem(name)
    if (!str) return null
    return superjson.parse(str)
  },
  setItem: (name, value) => {
    localStorage.setItem(name, superjson.stringify(value))
  },
  removeItem: (name) => localStorage.removeItem(name),
}

const initialState: BearState = {
  bear: new Map(),
  fish: new Set(),
  time: new Date(),
  query: new RegExp(''),
}

export const useBearStore = create<BearState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      ...initialState,
      // ...
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage',
      storage,
    },
  ),
)
```

### How can I rehydrate on storage event

You can use the Persist API to create your own implementation,
similar to the example below:

```ts
type StoreWithPersist = Mutate<StoreApi<State>, [["zustand/persist", unknown]]>

export const withStorageDOMEvents = (store: StoreWithPersist) => {
  const storageEventCallback = (e: StorageEvent) => {
    if (e.key === store.persist.getOptions().name && e.newValue) {
      store.persist.rehydrate()
    }
  }

  window.addEventListener('storage', storageEventCallback)

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('storage', storageEventCallback)
  }
}

const useBoundStore = create(persist(...))
withStorageDOMEvents(useBoundStore)
```

### How do I use it with TypeScript

Basic typescript usage doesn't require anything special
except for writing `create<State>()(...)` instead of `create(...)`.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface MyState {
  bears: number
  addABear: () => void
}

export const useBearStore = create<MyState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      bears: 0,
      addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'food-storage', // name of item in the storage (must be unique)
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => sessionStorage), // (optional) by default the 'localStorage' is used
      partialize: (state) => ({ bears: state.bears }),
    },
  ),
)
```

### How do I use it with Map and Set

In order to persist object types such as `Map` and `Set`, they will need to be converted to JSON-serializable types such as an `Array` which can be done by defining a custom `storage` engine.

Let's say your state uses `Map` to handle a list of `transactions`,
then you can convert the `Map` into an `Array` in the `storage` prop which is shown below:

```ts

interface BearState {
  .
  .
  .
  transactions: Map<any>
}

  storage: {
    getItem: (name) => {
      const str = localStorage.getItem(name);
      if (!str) return null;
      const existingValue = JSON.parse(str);
      return {
        ...existingValue,
        state: {
          ...existingValue.state,
          transactions: new Map(existingValue.state.transactions),
        }
      }
    },
    setItem: (name, newValue: StorageValue<BearState>) => {
      // functions cannot be JSON encoded
      const str = JSON.stringify({
        ...newValue,
        state: {
          ...newValue.state,
          transactions: Array.from(newValue.state.transactions.entries()),
        },
      })
      localStorage.setItem(name, str)
    },
    removeItem: (name) => localStorage.removeItem(name),
  },
```

---
title: Immer middleware
nav: 35
---

The [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) middleware enables you
to use immutable state in a more convenient way.
Also, with Immer, you can simplify handling
immutable data structures in Zustand.

## Installation

In order to use the Immer middleware in Zustand,
you will need to install Immer as a direct dependency.

```bash
npm install immer
```

## Usage

(Notice the extra parentheses after the type parameter as mentioned in the [Advanced Typescript Guide](../../learn/guides/advanced-typescript.md)).

Updating simple states

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  increment: (qty: number) => void
  decrement: (qty: number) => void
}

export const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>()(
  immer((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: (qty: number) =>
      set((state) => {
        state.count += qty
      }),
    decrement: (qty: number) =>
      set((state) => {
        state.count -= qty
      }),
  })),
)
```

Updating complex states

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer'

interface Todo {
  id: string
  title: string
  done: boolean
}

type State = {
  todos: Record<string, Todo>
}

type Actions = {
  toggleTodo: (todoId: string) => void
}

export const useTodoStore = create<State & Actions>()(
  immer((set) => ({
    todos: {
      '82471c5f-4207-4b1d-abcb-b98547e01a3e': {
        id: '82471c5f-4207-4b1d-abcb-b98547e01a3e',
        title: 'Learn Zustand',
        done: false,
      },
      '354ee16c-bfdd-44d3-afa9-e93679bda367': {
        id: '354ee16c-bfdd-44d3-afa9-e93679bda367',
        title: 'Learn Jotai',
        done: false,
      },
      '771c85c5-46ea-4a11-8fed-36cc2c7be344': {
        id: '771c85c5-46ea-4a11-8fed-36cc2c7be344',
        title: 'Learn Valtio',
        done: false,
      },
      '363a4bac-083f-47f7-a0a2-aeeee153a99c': {
        id: '363a4bac-083f-47f7-a0a2-aeeee153a99c',
        title: 'Learn Signals',
        done: false,
      },
    },
    toggleTodo: (todoId: string) =>
      set((state) => {
        state.todos[todoId].done = !state.todos[todoId].done
      }),
  })),
)
```

## Gotchas

In this section you will find some things
that you need to keep in mind when using Zustand with Immer.

### My subscriptions aren't being called

If you are using Immer,
make sure you are actually following
[the rules of Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/pitfalls).

For example, you have to add `[immerable] = true` for
[class objects](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/complex-objects) to work.
If you don't do this, Immer will still mutate the object,
but not as a proxy, so it will also update the current state.
Zustand checks if the state has actually changed,
so since both the current state and the next state are
equal (if you don't do it correctly),
Zustand will skip calling the subscriptions.

# combine

`combine` middleware lets you create a cohesive state by merging an initial state with a state
creator function that adds new state slices and actions. This is really helpful as it automatically
infers types, so there’s no need for explicit type definitions.

> [!TIP]
> This makes state management more straightforward and efficient by making curried version of
> `create` and `createStore` not necessary for middleware usage.

```js
const nextStateCreatorFn = combine(initialState, additionalStateCreatorFn)
```

  - [Signature](#signature)
- [Reference](#reference)
- [Usage](#usage)
  - [Creating a store with inferred types](#creating-a-store-with-inferred-types)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Types

### Signature

```ts
combine<T, U>(initialState: T, additionalStateCreatorFn: StateCreator<T, [], [], U>): StateCreator<Omit<T, keyof U> & U, [], []>
```

## Reference

### `combine(initialState, additionalStateCreatorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `initialState`: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type,
  except a function.
- `additionalStateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as
  arguments. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.

#### Returns

`combine` returns a state creator function.

## Usage

### Creating a store with inferred types

This example shows you how you can create a store and get types automatically inferred, so you
don’t need to define them explicitly.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'

const positionStore = createStore(
  combine({ position: { x: 0, y: 0 } }, (set) => ({
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  })),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getInitialState(), positionStore.getInitialState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>

# devtools

`devtools` middleware lets you use [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools)
without Redux. Read more about the benefits of using [Redux DevTools for debugging](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#use-the-redux-devtools-extension-for-debugging).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to use `devtools` from `zustand/middleware` you need to install
> `@redux-devtools/extension` library.

```js
const nextStateCreatorFn = devtools(stateCreatorFn, devtoolsOptions)
```

## Types

### Signature

```ts
devtools<T>(stateCreatorFn: StateCreator<T, [], []>, devtoolsOptions?: DevtoolsOptions): StateCreator<T, [['zustand/devtools', never]], []>
```

### Mutator

```ts
;['zustand/devtools', never]
```

## Reference

### `devtools(stateCreatorFn, devtoolsOptions)`

#### Parameters

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.
- **optional** `devtoolsOptions`: An object to define `Redux Devtools` options.
  - **optional** `name`: A custom identifier for the connection in the Redux DevTools.
  - **optional** `enabled`: Defaults to `true` when is on development mode, and defaults to `false`
    when is on production mode. Enables or disables the Redux DevTools integration
    for this store.
  - **optional** `anonymousActionType`: Defaults to the inferred action type or `anonymous` if
    unavailable. A string to use as the action type for anonymous mutations in the Redux DevTools.
  - **optional** `store`: A custom identifier for the store in the Redux DevTools.
  - **optional** `actionsDenylist`: A string or array of strings (regex patterns) that specify which
    actions should be filtered out from Redux DevTools. This option is passed directly to Redux DevTools
    for filtering. For example, `['secret.*']` will filter out all actions starting with "secret".

#### Returns

`devtools` returns a state creator function.

## Usage

### Debugging a store

This example shows you how you can use `Redux Devtools` to debug a store

```ts
import { create, StateCreator } from 'zustand'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

type JungleStore = {
  bears: number
  addBear: () => void
  fishes: number
  addFish: () => void
}

const useJungleStore = create<JungleStore>()(
  devtools((set) => ({
    bears: 0,
    addBear: () =>
      set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 }), undefined, 'jungle/addBear'),
    fishes: 0,
    addFish: () =>
      set(
        (state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 }),
        undefined,
        'jungle/addFish',
      ),
  })),
)
```

### Debugging a Slices pattern based store

This example shows you how you can use `Redux Devtools` to debug a Slices pattern based store

```ts
import { create, StateCreator } from 'zustand'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

type BearSlice = {
  bears: number
  addBear: () => void
}

type FishSlice = {
  fishes: number
  addFish: () => void
}

type JungleStore = BearSlice & FishSlice

const createBearSlice: StateCreator<
  JungleStore,
  [['zustand/devtools', never]],
  [],
  BearSlice
> = (set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addBear: () =>
    set(
      (state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 }),
      undefined,
      'jungle:bear/addBear',
    ),
})

const createFishSlice: StateCreator<
  JungleStore,
  [['zustand/devtools', never]],
  [],
  FishSlice
> = (set) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  addFish: () =>
    set(
      (state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 }),
      undefined,
      'jungle:fish/addFish',
    ),
})

const useJungleStore = create<JungleStore>()(
  devtools((...args) => ({
    ...createBearSlice(...args),
    ...createFishSlice(...args),
  })),
)
```

### Filtering actions with actionsDenylist

You can filter out specific actions from Redux DevTools using the `actionsDenylist` option. This is useful for hiding internal or sensitive actions from the DevTools timeline.

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

type Store = {
  user: string | null
  token: string | null
  login: (user: string, token: string) => void
  logout: () => void
  updateData: () => void
}

const useStore = create<Store>()(
  devtools(
    (set) => ({
      user: null,
      token: null,
      login: (user, token) => set({ user, token }, undefined, 'auth/login'),
      logout: () => set({ user: null, token: null }, undefined, 'auth/logout'),
      updateData: () =>
        set({ user: 'updated' }, undefined, 'internal/updateData'),
    }),
    {
      name: 'AuthStore',
      // Filter out actions matching these regex patterns
      actionsDenylist: ['internal/.*'], // Hides all 'internal/*' actions
    },
  ),
)
```

You can also use a single regex string:

```ts
const useStore = create<Store>()(
  devtools(
    (set) => ({
      // ... state and actions
    }),
    {
      name: 'MyStore',
      actionsDenylist: 'secret.*', // Hides all actions starting with 'secret'
    },
  ),
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `actionsDenylist` option uses regex pattern matching and is handled directly by Redux DevTools Extension.
> All actions are still sent to DevTools, but matching actions are filtered from the display.

### Cleanup

When a store is no longer needed, you can clean up the Redux DevTools connection by calling the `cleanup` method on the store:

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useStore = create(
  devtools((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  })),
)

// When you're done with the store, clean it up
useStore.devtools.cleanup()
```

This is particularly useful in applications that wrap store in context or create multiple stores dynamically.

## Troubleshooting

### Only one store is displayed

By default, `Redux Devtools` only show one store at a time, so in order to see other stores you
need to use store selector and choose a different store.

### All action names are labeled as 'anonymous'

If an action type name is not provided, it is defaulted to "anonymous". You can customize this
default value by providing a `anonymousActionType` parameter:

For instance the next example doesn't have action type name:

```ts
import { create, StateCreator } from 'zustand'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

type BearSlice = {
  bears: number
  addBear: () => void
}

type FishSlice = {
  fishes: number
  addFish: () => void
}

type JungleStore = BearSlice & FishSlice

const createBearSlice: StateCreator<
  JungleStore,
  [['zustand/devtools', never]],
  [],
  BearSlice
> = (set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addBear: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  eatFish: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes - 1 })),
})

const createFishSlice: StateCreator<
  JungleStore,
  [['zustand/devtools', never]],
  [],
  FishSlice
> = (set) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  addFish: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 })),
})

const useJungleStore = create<JungleStore>()(
  devtools((...args) => ({
    ...createBearSlice(...args),
    ...createFishSlice(...args),
  })),
)
```

In order to fix the previous example, we need to provide an action type name as the third parameter.
Additionally, to preserve the default behavior of the replacement logic, the second parameter
should be set to `undefined`.

Here's the fixed previous example

```ts
import { create, StateCreator } from 'zustand'

type BearSlice = {
  bears: number
  addBear: () => void
}

type FishSlice = {
  fishes: number
  addFish: () => void
}

type JungleStore = BearSlice & FishSlice

const createBearSlice: StateCreator<
  JungleStore,
  [['zustand/devtools', never]],
  [],
  BearSlice
> = (set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addBear: () =>
    set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 }), undefined, 'bear/addBear'),
})

const createFishSlice: StateCreator<
  JungleStore,
  [['zustand/devtools', never]],
  [],
  FishSlice
> = (set) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  addFish: () =>
    set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 }), undefined, 'fish/addFish'),
})

const useJungleStore = create<JungleStore>()(
  devtools((...args) => ({
    ...createBearSlice(...args),
    ...createFishSlice(...args),
  })),
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not set the second parameter to `true` or `false` unless you want to override the default
> replacement logic

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.

#### Returns

## Usage

### Updating state without boilerplate code

In the next example, we're going to update the `person` object. Since it's a nested object, we need
to create a copy of the entire object before making the update.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (
    nextPerson: (
      person: PersonStoreState['person'],
    ) => PersonStoreState['person'] | PersonStoreState['person'],
  ) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const personStore = createStore<PersonStore>()((set) => ({
  person: {
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  },
  setPerson: (nextPerson) =>
    set((state) => ({
      person:
        typeof nextPerson === 'function'
          ? nextPerson(state.person)
          : nextPerson,
    })),
}))

const $firstNameInput = document.getElementById(
  'first-name',
) as HTMLInputElement
const $lastNameInput = document.getElementById('last-name') as HTMLInputElement
const $emailInput = document.getElementById('email') as HTMLInputElement
const $result = document.getElementById('result') as HTMLDivElement

function handleFirstNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson((person) => ({
    ...person,
    firstName: (event.target as any).value,
  }))
}

function handleLastNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson((person) => ({
    ...person,
    lastName: (event.target as any).value,
  }))
}

function handleEmailChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson((person) => ({
    ...person,
    email: (event.target as any).value,
  }))
}

$firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleFirstNameChange)
$lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleLastNameChange)
$emailInput.addEventListener('input', handleEmailChange)

const render: Parameters<typeof personStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $firstNameInput.value = state.person.firstName
  $lastNameInput.value = state.person.lastName
  $emailInput.value = state.person.email

  $result.innerHTML = `${state.person.firstName} ${state.person.lastName} (${state.person.email})`
}

render(personStore.getInitialState(), personStore.getInitialState())

personStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<label style="display: block">
  First name:
  <input id="first-name" />
</label>
<label style="display: block">
  Last name:
  <input id="last-name" />
</label>
<label style="display: block">
  Email:
  <input id="email" />
</label>
<p id="result"></p>
```

To avoid manually copying the entire object before making updates, we'll use the `immer`
middleware.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer'

type PersonStoreState = {
  person: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }
}

type PersonStoreActions = {
  setPerson: (
    nextPerson: (
      person: PersonStoreState['person'],
    ) => PersonStoreState['person'] | PersonStoreState['person'],
  ) => void
}

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & PersonStoreActions

const personStore = createStore<PersonStore>()(
  immer((set) => ({
    person: {
      firstName: 'Barbara',
      lastName: 'Hepworth',
      email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
    },
    setPerson: (nextPerson) =>
      set((state) => {
        state.person =
          typeof nextPerson === 'function'
            ? nextPerson(state.person)
            : nextPerson
      }),
  })),
)

const $firstNameInput = document.getElementById(
  'first-name',
) as HTMLInputElement
const $lastNameInput = document.getElementById('last-name') as HTMLInputElement
const $emailInput = document.getElementById('email') as HTMLInputElement
const $result = document.getElementById('result') as HTMLDivElement

function handleFirstNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson((person) => {
    person.firstName = (event.target as any).value
  })
}

function handleLastNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson((person) => {
    person.lastName = (event.target as any).value
  })
}

function handleEmailChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.getState().setPerson((person) => {
    person.email = (event.target as any).value
  })
}

$firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleFirstNameChange)
$lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleLastNameChange)
$emailInput.addEventListener('input', handleEmailChange)

const render: Parameters<typeof personStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $firstNameInput.value = state.person.firstName
  $lastNameInput.value = state.person.lastName
  $emailInput.value = state.person.email

  $result.innerHTML = `${state.person.firstName} ${state.person.lastName} (${state.person.email})`
}

render(personStore.getInitialState(), personStore.getInitialState())

personStore.subscribe(render)
```

## Reference

### `persist(stateCreatorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.
- `persistOptions`: An object to define storage options.
  - `name`: A unique name of the item for your store in the storage.
  - **optional** `storage`: Defaults to `createJSONStorage(() => localStorage)`.
  - **optional** `partialize`: A function to filter state fields before persisting it.
  - **optional** `onRehydrateStorage`: A function or function returning a function that allows
    custom logic before and after state rehydration.
  - **optional** `version`: A version number for the persisted state. If the stored state version
    doesn't match, it won't be used.
  - **optional** `migrate`: A function to migrate persisted state if the version mismatch occurs.
  - **optional** `merge`: A function for custom logic when merging persisted state with the current
    state during rehydration. Defaults to a shallow merge.
  - **optional** `skipHydration`: Defaults to `false`. If `true`, the middleware won't
    automatically rehydrate the state on initialization. Use `rehydrate` function manually in this
    case. This is useful for server-side rendering (SSR) applications.

#### Returns

`persist` returns a state creator function.

## Usage

### Persisting a state

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple position tracker using vanilla store and the `persist`
middleware. The example tracks the `position` of the mouse as it moves within a container and
stores the `position` in local storage, so it persists even when the page reloads.

We start by setting up a vanilla store that holds the position (an object with `x` and `y`
coordinates) and an action to update it. We'll also use the `persist` middleware to store the
position in `localStorage`.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    { name: 'position-storage' },
  ),
)
```

Next, we'll track the mouse movements inside a div and update the store with the new position.

```ts
const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})
```

We want to reflect the position updates on the screen by moving a div element
(representing the dot) to the new coordinates.

```ts
const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here’s the complete code.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    { name: 'position-storage' },
  ),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Persisting a state partially

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple position tracker using vanilla store and the `persist`
middleware. Additionally, we'll show you how to persist only part of the state
(partial persistence), which can be useful when you don’t want to store the entire state in
`localStorage`.

We’ll first create a vanilla store that holds the position state and actions to update it. We'll
use the `persist` middleware to persist only the relevant part of the state (in this case, the
context containing the position).

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = {
  context: {
    position: { x: number; y: number }
  }
}

type PositionStoreActions = {
  actions: {
    setPosition: (
      nextPosition: PositionStoreState['context']['position'],
    ) => void
  }
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      context: {
        position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      },
      actions: {
        setPosition: (position) => set({ context: { position } }),
      },
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      partialize: (state) => ({ context: state.context }),
    },
  ),
)
```

Next, we'll track the mouse movements inside a div and update the store with the new position.

```ts
const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().actions.setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})
```

We want to reflect the position updates on the screen by moving a div element
(representing the dot) to the new coordinates.

```ts
const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.context.position.x}px, ${state.context.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here’s the full code to create a dot that follows your mouse movement inside a container and
persists the `context` in `localStorage`.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = {
  context: {
    position: { x: number; y: number }
  }
}

type PositionStoreActions = {
  actions: {
    setPosition: (
      nextPosition: PositionStoreState['context']['position'],
    ) => void
  }
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      context: {
        position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      },
      actions: {
        setPosition: (position) => set({ context: { position } }),
      },
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      partialize: (state) => ({ context: state.context }),
    },
  ),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().actions.setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.context.position.x}px, ${state.context.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>

### Persisting a state with custom storage

In this mini tutorial, we’ll create a simple position-tracking system using vanilla store, where
the position state is persisted in the URL's search parameters. This approach allows state
persistence directly in the browser's URL, which can be useful for maintaining state across page
reloads or sharing links with state embedded.

We need to implement functions to manipulate URL search parameters as if they were a storage
mechanism. This includes retrieving, setting, and removing parameters.

```ts
const getSearchParams = () => {
  return new URL(location.href).searchParams
}

const updateSearchParams = (searchParams: URLSearchParams) => {
  window.history.replaceState(
    {},
    '',
    `${location.pathname}?${searchParams.toString()}`,
  )
}

const getSearchParam = (key: string) => {
  const searchParams = getSearchParams()
  return searchParams.get(key)
}

const updateSearchParam = (key: string, value: string) => {
  const searchParams = getSearchParams()
  searchParams.set(key, value)

  updateSearchParams(searchParams)
}

const removeSearchParam = (key: string) => {
  const searchParams = getSearchParams()
  searchParams.delete(key)

  updateSearchParams(searchParams)
}
```

To use the URL search parameters as storage, we define a `searchParamsStorage` object with
`getItem`, `setItem`, and `removeItem` methods. These methods map to our custom functions that
manipulate search parameters.

```ts
const searchParamsStorage = {
  getItem: (key: string) => getSearchParam(key),
  setItem: (key: string, value: string) => updateSearchParam(key, value),
  removeItem: (key: string) => removeSearchParam(key),
}
```

Now, we initialize the vanilla store using the `persist` middleware, specifying that we want to use
our custom storage. Instead of the default `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, we’ll persist the
position data in the URL search parameters.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => searchParamsStorage),
    },
  ),
)
```

Next, we'll track the mouse movements inside a div and update the store with the new position.

```ts
const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})
```

We want to reflect the position updates on the screen by moving a div element
(representing the dot) to the new coordinates.

```ts
const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here’s the full code to create a dot that follows your mouse movement inside a container and
persists the position in URL's search parameters.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const getSearchParams = () => {
  return new URL(location.href).searchParams
}

const updateSearchParams = (searchParams: URLSearchParams) => {
  window.history.replaceState(
    {},
    '',
    `${location.pathname}?${searchParams.toString()}`,
  )
}

const getSearchParam = (key: string) => {
  const searchParams = getSearchParams()
  return searchParams.get(key)
}

const updateSearchParam = (key: string, value: string) => {
  const searchParams = getSearchParams()
  searchParams.set(key, value)

  updateSearchParams(searchParams)
}

const removeSearchParam = (key: string) => {
  const searchParams = getSearchParams()
  searchParams.delete(key)

  updateSearchParams(searchParams)
}

const searchParamsStorage = {
  getItem: (key: string) => getSearchParam(key),
  setItem: (key: string, value: string) => updateSearchParam(key, value),
  removeItem: (key: string) => removeSearchParam(key),
}

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => searchParamsStorage),
    },
  ),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Persisting a state through versioning and migrations

In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to manage state persistence using versioning and migration.
We will demonstrate how to evolve your state schema across versions without breaking existing
persisted data.

Before moving to versioned state management, we simulate an initial state for `version` 0. This is
done by manually setting a `version` 0 state in `localStorage` if it doesn't already exist. The
`version` 0 state saves the coordinates as `x` and `y` fields.

```ts
// For tutorial purposes only
if (!localStorage.getItem('position-storage')) {
  localStorage.setItem(
    'position-storage',
    JSON.stringify({
      state: { x: 100, y: 100 }, // version 0 structure
      version: 0,
    }),
  )
}
```

Next, we use `persist` middleware to handle state persistence. We also add a migration function to
handle changes between versions. In this example, we `migrate` the state from `version` 0 (where
`x` and `y` are separate) to `version` 1, where they are combined into a `position` object.

```ts
migrate: (persisted: any, version) => {
  if (version === 0) {
    persisted.position = { x: persisted.x, y: persisted.y }
    delete persisted.x
    delete persisted.y
  }

  return persisted
}
```

Next, we'll track the mouse movements inside a div and update the store with the new position.

```ts
const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})
```

We want to reflect the position updates on the screen by moving a div element
(representing the dot) to the new coordinates.

```ts
const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here’s the complete code.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

// For tutorial purposes only
if (!localStorage.getItem('position-storage')) {
  localStorage.setItem(
    'position-storage',
    JSON.stringify({
      state: { x: 100, y: 100 },
      version: 0,
    }),
  )
}

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // version 0: just x: 0, y: 0
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      version: 1,
      migrate: (persisted: any, version) => {
        if (version === 0) {
          persisted.position = { x: persisted.x, y: persisted.y }
          delete persisted.x
          delete persisted.y
        }

        return persisted
      },
    },
  ),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Persisting a state with nested objects

In this tutorial, we’ll create a vanilla store that keeps track of a position represented by `x`
and `y` coordinates. We will also implement persistence using `localStorage` and demonstrate how to
handle merging of state with potentially missing fields.

To simulate an initial state for the tutorial, we will check if our position data exists in
`localStorage`. If it doesn't, we’ll set it up.

```ts
if (!localStorage.getItem('position-storage')) {
  localStorage.setItem(
    'position-storage',
    JSON.stringify({
      state: { position: { y: 100 } }, // missing `x` field
      version: 0,
    }),
  )
}
```

Now, we will create the store and configure it to use persistence and deep merging.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'
import createDeepMerge from '@fastify/deepmerge'

const deepMerge = createDeepMerge({ all: true })

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      merge: (persisted, current) => deepMerge(current, persisted) as never,
    },
  ),
)
```

Next, we'll track the mouse movements inside a div and update the store with the new position.

```ts
const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})
```

We want to reflect the position updates on the screen by moving a div element
(representing the dot) to the new coordinates.

```ts
const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here’s the complete code.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'
import createDeepMerge from '@fastify/deepmerge'

const deepMerge = createDeepMerge({ all: true })

// For tutorial purposes only
if (!localStorage.getItem('position-storage')) {
  localStorage.setItem(
    'position-storage',
    JSON.stringify({
      state: { position: { y: 100 } }, // missing `x` field
      version: 0,
    }),
  )
}

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      merge: (persisted, current) => deepMerge(current, persisted) as never,
    },
  ),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  console.log({ state })
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

### Persisting a state and hydrate it manually

In this tutorial, we’ll create a vanilla store that keeps track of a position represented by `x`
and `y` coordinates. We will also implement persistence using `localStorage` and explore how to
skip the hydration process and manually trigger rehydration after a delay.

We start by setting up a vanilla store that holds the position (an object with `x` and `y`
coordinates) and an action to update it. Furthermore, we'll also use the `persist` middleware to
store the position in `localStorage` but skipping hydration.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      skipHydration: true,
    },
  ),
)
```

Since we skipped hydration in the initial setup, we will manually rehydrate the state. Here, we’re
using `setTimeout` to simulate a delayed rehydration.

```ts
setTimeout(() => {
  positionStore.persist.rehydrate()
}, 2000)
```

Next, we'll track the mouse movements inside a div and update the store with the new position.

```ts
const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})
```

We want to reflect the position updates on the screen by moving a div element
(representing the dot) to the new coordinates.

```ts
const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here’s the complete code.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'position-storage',
      skipHydration: true,
    },
  ),
)

const $dotContainer = document.getElementById('dot-container') as HTMLDivElement
const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dotContainer.addEventListener('pointermove', (event) => {
  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY,
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

setTimeout(() => {
  positionStore.persist.rehydrate()
}, 2000)

render(positionStore.getState(), positionStore.getState())

positionStore.subscribe(render)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

## Usage

### Updating state through actions and reducers

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { redux } from 'zustand/middleware'

  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

type PersonStoreAction =
  | { type: 'person/setFirstName'; firstName: string }
  | { type: 'person/setLastName'; lastName: string }
  | { type: 'person/setEmail'; email: string }

type PersonStore = PersonStoreState & {

      return { ...state, lastName: action.lastName }
    }
    case 'person/setEmail': {
      return { ...state, email: action.email }
    }
    default: {
      return state
    }
  }
}

const personStoreInitialState: PersonStoreState = {
  firstName: 'Barbara',
  lastName: 'Hepworth',
  email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
}

const personStore = createStore<PersonStore>()(
  redux(personStoreReducer, personStoreInitialState),
)

    firstName: (event.target as any).value,
  })
}

function handleLastNameChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.dispatch({
    type: 'person/setLastName',
    lastName: (event.target as any).value,
  })
}

function handleEmailChange(event: Event) {
  personStore.dispatch({
    type: 'person/setEmail',
    email: (event.target as any).value,
  })
}

$firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleFirstNameChange)
$lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', handleLastNameChange)
$emailInput.addEventListener('input', handleEmailChange)

const render: Parameters<typeof personStore.subscribe>[0] = (person) => {
  $firstNameInput.value = person.firstName

# subscribeWithSelector

`subscribeWithSelector` middleware lets you subscribe to specific data based on current state.

```js
const nextStateCreatorFn = subscribeWithSelector(stateCreatorFn)
```

- [Types](#types)
  - [Signature](#signature)
  - [Mutator](#mutator)
- [Reference](#reference)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Types

### Signature

```ts
subscribeWithSelector<T>(stateCreatorFn: StateCreator<T, [], []>): StateCreator<T, [['zustand/subscribeWithSelector', never]], []>
```

### Mutator

```ts
;['zustand/subscribeWithSelector', never]
```

## Reference

### `subscribeWithSelector(stateCreatorFn)`

#### Parameters

- `stateCreatorFn`: A function that takes `set` function, `get` function and `store` as arguments.
  Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.

#### Returns

`subscribeWithSelector` returns a state creator function.

## Usage

### Subscribing partial state updates

By subscribing to partial state updates, you register a callback that fires whenever the store's
partial state updates. We can use `subscribe` for external state management.

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla'
import { subscribeWithSelector } from 'zustand/middleware'

type PositionStoreState = { position: { x: number; y: number } }

type PositionStoreActions = {
  setPosition: (nextPosition: PositionStoreState['position']) => void
}

type PositionStore = PositionStoreState & PositionStoreActions

const positionStore = createStore<PositionStore>()(
  subscribeWithSelector((set) => ({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    setPosition: (position) => set({ position }),
  })),
)

const $dot = document.getElementById('dot') as HTMLDivElement

$dot.addEventListener('mouseenter', (event) => {
  const parent = event.currentTarget.parentElement
  const parentWidth = parent.clientWidth
  const parentHeight = parent.clientHeight

  positionStore.getState().setPosition({
    x: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentWidth),
    y: Math.ceil(Math.random() * parentHeight),
  })
})

const render: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (state) => {
  $dot.style.transform = `translate(${state.position.x}px, ${state.position.y}px)`
}

render(positionStore.getInitialState(), positionStore.getInitialState())

positionStore.subscribe((state) => state.position, render)

const logger: Parameters<typeof positionStore.subscribe>[0] = (x) => {
  console.log('new x position', { x })
}

positionStore.subscribe((state) => state.position.x, logger)
```

Here's the `html` code

```html
<div
  id="dot-container"
  style="position: relative; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"
>
  <div
    id="dot"
    style="position: absolute; background-color: red; border-radius: 50%; left: -10px; top: -10px; width: 20px; height: 20px;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

The only breaking changes are in types.
If you are using Zustand with TypeScript
or JSDoc type annotations,
this guide applies.
Otherwise, no migration is required.

Also, it's recommended to first read
the new [TypeScript Guide](../../learn/guides/advanced-typescript.md),
so that the migration is easier to understand.

In addition to this migration guide,
you can also check the
[diff](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/compare/v3.7.2...v4.0.0?short_path=37e5b4c#diff-c21e24854115b390eccde717da83f91feb2d5927a76c1485e5f0fdd0135c2afa)
of the test files in the Zustand repository from v3 to v4.

## `create`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import create from 'zustand'
import create from 'zustand/vanilla'
```

**Change**

```diff
- create:
-   < State
-   , StoreSetState = StoreApi<State>["set"]
-   , StoreGetState = StoreApi<State>["get"]
-   , Store = StoreApi<State>
-   >
-     (f: ...) => ...
+ create:
+   { <State>(): (f: ...) => ...
+   , <State, Mutators>(f: ...) => ...
+   }
```

**Migration**

If you are not passing any type parameters to `create`,
no migration is required.

If you are using a "leaf" middleware like `combine` or `redux`,
remove all type parameters from `create`.

Else, replace `create<T, ...>(...)` with `create<T>()(...)`.

## `StateCreator`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import type { StateCreator } from 'zustand'
import type { StateCreator } from 'zustand/vanilla'
```

**Change**

```diff
- type StateCreator
-   < State
-   , StoreSetState = StoreApi<State>["set"]
-   , StoreGetState = StoreApi<State>["get"]
-   , Store = StoreApi<State>
-   > =
-     ...
+ type StateCreator
+   < State
+   , InMutators extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = []
+   , OutMutators extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = []
+   , Return = State
+   > =
+     ...
```

**Migration**

If you are using `StateCreator`,
you are likely authoring a middleware
or using the "slices" pattern.
For that check the
[Authoring middlewares and advanced usage](../../learn/guides/advanced-typescript.md#authoring-middlewares-and-advanced-usage)
and [Common recipes](../../learn/guides/advanced-typescript.md#common-recipes)
sections of the TypeScript Guide.

## `PartialState`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import type { PartialState } from 'zustand'
import type { PartialState } from 'zustand/vanilla'
```

**Change**

```diff
- type PartialState
-   < T extends State
-   , K1 extends keyof T = keyof T
-   , K2 extends keyof T = K1
-   , K3 extends keyof T = K2
-   , K4 extends keyof T = K3
-   > =
-   | (Pick<T, K1> | Pick<T, K2> | Pick<T, K3> | Pick<T, K4> | T)
-   | ((state: T) => Pick<T, K1> | Pick<T, K2> | Pick<T, K3> | Pick<T, K4> | T)
+ type PartialState<T> =
+   | Partial<T>
+   | ((state: T) => Partial<T>)
```

**Migration**

Replace `PartialState<T, ...>` with `PartialState<T>`
and preferably turn on [`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

We're no longer using the trick to disallow `{ foo: undefined }`
to be assigned to `Partial<{ foo: string }>`.
Instead, we're relying on the users to turn on `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

## `useStore`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import { useStore } from 'zustand'
import { useStore } from 'zustand/react'
```

**Change**

```diff
- useStore:
-   { <State>(store: StoreApi<State>): State
-   , <State, StateSlice>
-       ( store: StoreApi<State>
-       , selector: StateSelector<State, StateSlice>,
-       , equals?: EqualityChecker<StateSlice>
-       ): StateSlice
-   }
+ useStore:
+   <Store, StateSlice = ExtractState<Store>>
+     ( store: Store
+     , selector?: StateSelector<State, StateSlice>,
+     , equals?: EqualityChecker<StateSlice>
+     )
+       => StateSlice
```

**Migration**

If you are not passing any type parameters to `useStore`,
no migration is required.

If you are,
it's recommended to remove all the type parameters,
or pass the **store** type instead of the **state** type as the first parameter.

## `UseBoundStore`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import type { UseBoundStore } from 'zustand'
import type { UseBoundStore } from 'zustand/react'
```

**Change**

```diff
- type UseBoundStore<
-   State,
-   Store = StoreApi<State>
- > =
-   & { (): T
-     , <StateSlice>
-         ( selector: StateSelector<State, StateSlice>
-         , equals?: EqualityChecker<StateSlice>
-         ): U
-     }
-   & Store
+ type UseBoundStore<Store> =
+   & (<StateSlice = ExtractState<S>>
+       ( selector?: (state: ExtractState<S>) => StateSlice
+       , equals?: (a: StateSlice, b: StateSlice) => boolean
+       ) => StateSlice
+     )
+   & S
```

**Migration**

Replace `UseBoundStore<T>` with `UseBoundStore<StoreApi<T>>`,
and `UseBoundStore<T, S>` with `UseBoundStore<S>`

## `UseContextStore`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import type { UseContextStore } from 'zustand/context'
```

**Change**

```diff
- type UseContextStore
```

**Migration**

Use `typeof MyContext.useStore` instead

## `createContext`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import createContext from 'zustand/context'
```

**Change**

```diff
  createContext:
-   <State, Store = StoreApi<State>>() => ...
+   <Store>() => ...
```

**Migration**

Replace `createContext<T>()` with `createContext<StoreApi<T>>()`,
and `createContext<T, S>()` with `createContext<S>()`.

## `combine`, `devtools`, `subscribeWithSelector`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import { combine } from 'zustand/middleware'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'
import { subscribeWithSelector } from 'zustand/middleware'
```

**Change**

```diff
- combine:
-   <T, U>(...) => ...
+ combine:
+   <T, U, Mps, Mcs>(...) => ...

- devtools:
-   <T>(...) => ...
+ devtools:
+   <T, Mps, Mcs>(...) => ...

- subscribeWithSelector:
-   <T>(...) => ...
+ subscribeWithSelector:
+   <T, Mps, Mcs>(...) => ...
```

**Migration**

If you are not passing any type parameters
to `combine`, `devtools`, or `subscribeWithSelector`,
no migration is required.

If you are,
remove all the type parameters,
as they are inferred automatically.

## `persist`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'
```

**Change**

```diff
- persist:
-   <T, U = Partial<T>>(...) => ...
+ persist:
+   <T, Mps, Mcs, U = T>(...) => ...
```

**Migration**

If you are passing any type parameters,
remove them as they are inferred automatically.

Next, if you are passing the `partialize` option,
there is no further steps required for migration.

If you are **not** passing the `partialize` option,
you might see some compilation errors.
If you do not see any,
there is no further migration required.

The type of partialized state is now `T` instead of `Partial<T>`,
which aligns with the runtime behavior of the default `partialize`,
which is an identity (`s => s`).

If you see some compilation errors,
you have to find and fix the errors yourself,
because they might be indicative of unsound code.
Alternatively, the workaround will be passing
`s => s as Partial<typeof s>` to `partialize`.
If your partialized state is truly `Partial<T>`,
you should not encounter any bugs.

The runtime behavior has not changed,
only the types are now correct.

## `redux`

**Applicable imports**

```ts
import { redux } from 'zustand/middleware'
```

**Change**

```diff
- redux:
-   <T, A>(...) => ...
+ redux:
+   <T, A, Mps, Mcs>(...) => ...
```

**Migration**

If you are not passing any type parameters to `redux`,
no migration is required.

If you are,
remove all the type parameters,
and annotate only the second (action) parameter.
That is, replace `redux<T, A>((state, action) => ..., ...)`
with `redux((state, action: A) => ..., ...)`.

# How to Migrate to v5 from v4

We highly recommend to update to the latest version of v4, before migrating to v5. It will show all deprecation warnings without breaking your app.

## Changes in v5

- Drop default exports
- Drop deprecated features
- Make React 18 the minimum required version
- Make use-sync-external-store a peer dependency (required for `createWithEqualityFn` and `useStoreWithEqualityFn` in `zustand/traditional`)
- Make TypeScript 4.5 the minimum required version
- Drop UMD/SystemJS support
- Organize entry points in the package.json
- Drop ES5 support
- Stricter types when setState's replace flag is set
- Persist middleware behavioral change
- Other small improvements (technically breaking changes)

## Migration Guide

### Using custom equality functions such as `shallow`

The `create` function in v5 does not support customizing equality function.

If you use custom equality function such as `shallow`,
the easiest migration is to use `createWithEqualityFn`.

```js
// v4
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  // ...
}))

const Component = () => {
  const { count, text } = useCountStore(
    (state) => ({
      count: state.count,
      text: state.text,
    }),
    shallow,
  )
  // ...
}
```

That can be done with `createWithEqualityFn` in v5:

```bash
npm install use-sync-external-store
```

```js
// v5
import { createWithEqualityFn as create } from 'zustand/traditional'

// The rest is the same as v4
```

Alternatively, for the `shallow` use case, you can use `useShallow` hook:

```js
// v5
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  // ...
}))

const Component = () => {
  const { count, text } = useCountStore(
    useShallow((state) => ({
      count: state.count,
      text: state.text,
    })),
  )
  // ...
}
```

### Requiring stable selector outputs

There is a behavioral change in v5 to match React default behavior.
If a selector returns a new reference, it may cause infinite loops.

For example, this may cause infinite loops.

```js
// v4
const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useStore((state) => [
  state.searchValue,
  state.setSearchValue,
])
```

The error message will be something like this:

```plaintext
Uncaught Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.
```

To fix it, use the `useShallow` hook, which will return a stable reference.

```js
// v5
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useStore(
  useShallow((state) => [state.searchValue, state.setSearchValue]),
)
```

Here's another example that may cause infinite loops.

```js
// v4
const action = useMainStore((state) => {
  return state.action ?? () => {}
})
```

To fix it, make sure the selector function returns a stable reference.

```js
// v5

const FALLBACK_ACTION = () => {}

const action = useMainStore((state) => {
  return state.action ?? FALLBACK_ACTION
})
```

Alternatively, if you need v4 behavior, `createWithEqualityFn` will do.

```js
// v5
import { createWithEqualityFn as create } from 'zustand/traditional'
```

### Stricter types when setState's replace flag is set (Typescript only)

```diff
- setState:
-   (partial: T | Partial<T> | ((state: T) => T | Partial<T>), replace?: boolean | undefined) => void;
+ setState:
+   (partial: T | Partial<T> | ((state: T) => T | Partial<T>), replace?: false) => void;
+   (state: T | ((state: T) => T), replace: true) => void;
```

If you are not using the `replace` flag, no migration is required.

If you are using the `replace` flag and it's set to `true`, you must provide a complete state object.
This change ensures that `store.setState({}, true)` (which results in an invalid state) is no longer considered valid.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Partial state update (valid)
store.setState({ key: 'value' })

// Complete state replacement (valid)
store.setState({ key: 'value' }, true)

// Incomplete state replacement (invalid)
store.setState({}, true) // Error
```

#### Handling Dynamic `replace` Flag

If the value of the `replace` flag is dynamic and determined at runtime, you might face issues. To handle this, you can use a workaround by annotating the `replace` parameter with the parameters of the `setState` function:

```ts
const replaceFlag = Math.random() > 0.5
const args = [{ bears: 5 }, replaceFlag] as Parameters<
  typeof useBearStore.setState
>
store.setState(...args)
```

#### Persist middleware no longer stores item at store creation

Previously, the `persist` middleware stored the initial state during store creation. This behavior has been removed in v5 (and v4.5.5).

For example, in the following code, the initial state is stored in the storage.

```js
// v4
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useCountStore = create(
  persist(
    () => ({
      count: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000),
    }),
    {
      name: 'count',
    },
  ),
)
```

In v5, this is no longer the case, and you need to explicitly set the state after store creation.

```js
// v5
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useCountStore = create(
  persist(
    () => ({
      count: 0,
    }),
    {
      name: 'count',
    },
  ),
)
useCountStore.setState({
  count: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000),
})
```

<!-- SOURCE: knowledge/official/stack/zustand/docs/reference/previous-versions/zustand-v3-create-context.md -->

---
title: createContext from zustand/context
nav: 39
---

A special `createContext` is provided since v3.5,
which avoids misusing the store hook.

> **Note**: This function is deprecated in v4 and will be removed in v5. See [Migration](#migration).

```jsx
import create from 'zustand'
import createContext from 'zustand/context'

const { Provider, useStore } = createContext()

const createStore = () => create(...)

const App = () => (
  <Provider createStore={createStore}>
    ...
  </Provider>
)

const Component = () => {
  const state = useStore()
  const slice = useStore(selector)
  ...
```

## createContext usage in real components

```jsx
import create from "zustand";
import createContext from "zustand/context";

// Best practice: You can move the below createContext() and createStore to a separate file(store.js) and import the Provider, useStore here/wherever you need.

const { Provider, useStore } = createContext();

const createStore = () =>
  create((set) => ({
    bears: 0,
    increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
    removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 })
  }));

const Button = () => {
  return (
      {/** store() - This will create a store for each time using the Button component instead of using one store for all components **/}
    <Provider createStore={createStore}>
      <ButtonChild />
    </Provider>
  );
};

const ButtonChild = () => {
  const state = useStore();
  return (
    <div>
      {state.bears}
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          state.increasePopulation();
        }}
      >
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Button />
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## createContext usage with initialization from props

```tsx
import create from 'zustand'
import createContext from 'zustand/context'

const { Provider, useStore } = createContext()

export default function App({ initialBears }) {
  return (
    <Provider
      createStore={() =>
        create((set) => ({
          bears: initialBears,
          increase: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
        }))
      }
    >
      <Button />
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

## Migration

Discussion: https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/discussions/1276

Here's the new context usage with v4 API.

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext, useRef } from 'react'
import { createStore, useStore } from 'zustand'

const StoreContext = createContext(null)

const StoreProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const storeRef = useRef()
  if (storeRef.current === null) {
    storeRef.current = createStore((set) => ({
      // ...
    }))
  }
  return (
    <StoreContext.Provider value={storeRef.current}>
      {children}
    </StoreContext.Provider>
  )
}

const useStoreInContext = (selector) => {
  const store = useContext(StoreContext)
  if (!store) {
    throw new Error('Missing StoreProvider')
  }
  return useStore(store, selector)
}
```

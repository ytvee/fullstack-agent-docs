#### Step 2 - Setup wrangler.toml

You would need to have a `wrangler.toml` file for D1 database and will look something like this:
```toml
name = "YOUR PROJECT NAME"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2022-11-07"
node_compat = true

[[ d1_databases ]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "YOUR DB NAME"
database_id = "YOUR DB ID"
migrations_dir = "drizzle"
```

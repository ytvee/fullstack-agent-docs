#### Setup Drizzle config file

**Drizzle config** - a configuration file that is used by [Drizzle Kit](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview) and contains all the information about your database connection, migration folder and schema files.

Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following content:

```typescript copy filename="drizzle.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./src/schema.ts",
  out: "./supabase/migrations",
  dialect: "postgresql",
});
```

In this tutorial we will use Drizzle kit to generate migrations for our schema.

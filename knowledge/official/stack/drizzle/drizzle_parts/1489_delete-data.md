#### Delete data

Read more about delete query in the [documentation](/docs/delete).

```typescript copy filename="src/queries/delete.ts" {5}
import { db } from '../db';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { SelectUser, usersTable } from '../schema';

export async function deleteUser(id: SelectUser['id']) {
  await db.delete(usersTable).where(eq(usersTable.id, id));
}
```

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Drizzle ORM with [Nile Database](https://thenile.dev). Nile is Postgres, re-engineered for multi-tenant applications. 

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Drizzle with Nile's virtual tenant databases to developer a secure, scalable, multi-tenant application. 

We'll walk through building this example application step-by-step. If you want to peek at the complete example, you can take a look at its [Github repository](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/tree/main/examples/quickstart/drizzle).

<Prerequisites>
- You should have installed Drizzle ORM and [Drizzle kit](/docs/kit-overview). You can do this by running the following command:
<Npm>
drizzle-orm
-D drizzle-kit
</Npm>
- You should have installed `dotenv` package for managing environment variables. Read more about this package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
<Npm>
  dotenv
</Npm>
- You should have installed `node-postgres` package for connecting to the Postgres database. Read more about this package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-postgres)
<Npm>
  node-postgres
</Npm>
- You should have installed `express` package for the web framework. Read more about express [here](https://expressjs.com/)
<Npm>
  express
</Npm>

- This guide uses [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html) to manage the tenant context. If your framework or runtime does not support `AsyncLocalStorage`, you can refer to [Drizzle\<\>Nile](../connect-nile) doc for alternative options.

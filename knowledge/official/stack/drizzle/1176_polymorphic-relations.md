### Polymorphic Relations

Polymorphic relationships are a more advanced concept that allows a single relationship to point to 
different types of entities or tables. It's about creating more flexible and adaptable relationships when 
you have different kinds of data that share some commonality.

Imagine you have an `activities` log. An activity could be a `comment` a `like` or a `share`.
Each of these `activity` types has different details. Instead of creating separate tables and 
relationships for each activity type and the things they relate to, you might use a polymorphic approach.

- **Comments/Reviews**: A "Comment" might be related to different types of content: articles, products, videos, etc. 
Instead of having separate article_id, product_id, video_id columns in a Comments table, you can use a 
polymorphic relationship.
```
+---------------------+
| **Comments**        |
+---------------------+
| PK comment_id       |
| commentable_type    | ------>  [Polymorphic Relationship]
| commentable_id      | -------->
| user_id             |
| comment_text        |
| ...                 |
+---------------------+
          ^
          |
+---------------------+    +---------------------+    +---------------------+
| **Articles**        |    | **Products**        |    | **Videos**          |
+---------------------+    +---------------------+    +---------------------+
| PK article_id       |    | PK product_id       |    | PK video_id         |
| ...                 |    | ...                 |    | ...                 |
+---------------------+    +---------------------+    +---------------------+
```
- **Notifications:** A notification could be related to a user, an order, a system event, etc.
```
+----------------------+
| **Notifications**    |
+----------------------+
| PK notification_id  |
| notifiable_type     | ------>  [Polymorphic Relationship]
| notifiable_id       | -------->
| user_id             |
| message             |
| ...                  |
+----------------------+
           ^
           |
+---------------------+    +---------------------+    +-----------------------+
| **Users**           |    | **Orders**          |    | **System Events**     |
+---------------------+    +---------------------+    +-----------------------+
| PK user_id          |    | PK order_id         |    | PK event_id           |
| ...                 |    | ...                 |    | ...                   |
+---------------------+    +---------------------+    +-----------------------+
```
</Callout>

Polymorphic relationships are more complex and are often handled at the application level or 
using more advanced database features (depending on the specific database system). Standard SQL doesn't 
have direct, built-in support for enforcing polymorphic foreign key constraints in the same way as regular foreign keys.

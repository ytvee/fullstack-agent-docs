# allowedDevOrigins

Next.js blocks cross-origin requests to dev-only assets and endpoints during development by default to prevent unauthorized access.

To configure a Next.js application to allow requests from origins other than the hostname the server was initialized with (`localhost` by default), use the `allowedDevOrigins` config option.

`allowedDevOrigins` lets you set additional origins that can request the dev server in development mode. For example, to use `local-origin.dev` instead of only `localhost`, open `next.config.js` and add the `allowedDevOrigins` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  allowedDevOrigins: ['local-origin.dev', '*.local-origin.dev'],
}
```

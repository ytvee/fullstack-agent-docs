# Frontend Security Inspector

## Mode

Manual only. Do not invoke unless the user explicitly asks for a security audit.

## Default workflow

1. Inspect the affected code and configuration.
2. Check the relevant React or Next.js security checklist.
3. Produce a structured findings report.
4. Suggest remediation tasks or implement follow-up fixes only when requested.

## Scope

- auth and session handling
- public entry points
- secrets and environment exposure
- client/server boundary mistakes
- unsafe data handling or validation gaps
